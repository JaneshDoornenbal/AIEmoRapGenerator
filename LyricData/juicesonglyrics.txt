My Margiela's make me Like Mike
Jumping from the free throw line
She's running through my head
Do Xanax 'til I'm dead
Came up on so much money that shit do not make no sense
My diamonds different colors like a rainbow in hair
I smoke away my problems but they won't disappear
I don't have any friends
I'm in it 'til the end
My girlfriend say she hate me cause' of percocets again
She always think I'm cheating, all these hoes in my crib
I tell her I don't love them I just fuck them and dip
I just fuck them and dip
Taste the Rainbow

Pockets so big not little
Got white like Malcolm no middle, oh
My bitch give me migraines, need percocets, no Tylenol

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin'

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex girlfriend keeps calling my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me

But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy show, I show no mercy
With my bros but I got my pole screaming "please don't urge me, please dont urge me," yuh

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin

She just want the diamonds on my neck, she gon catch a cold
I just fell in love with her neck, I can't let her go

'Member when I met her in the trap, she was scraping bowls
Whipping work, running from the cops, she was hitting curbs
In the car, singing all my songs, she knew all the words

Keep the heavy metal in my skin, these like a rocker

If you end up power, fill em up with hollows
I sip Hennessy, won't catch me popping bottles (ay)

There's a room full of hoes getting wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V (yeah, ay)

But who had your back? Me, I did


They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Error

Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)


Ooh, ooh
Like oh-woah

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh

Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my dorm, I see her face in my room
When im along in the room I'ma blame that on the shrooms
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh


[laughing]
Hello? Oh my god!

Oouuff, ooh my god
Yeah, yeah its cool [laughing]
Hello? What in the fuck did I tell you about calling me?
You found out about who?
Yeah, I bet you did found out about him too
Yeah, I fuck with him, I fuck with him for real [laughing]
Oh, you mad now?
Nigga you ain't mad about shit [indistinct laughing] (Girl pour me another one)
Okay whatever [laughing]
I'll talk to you later okay
Nah, nah I ain't even gone talk to you later
Don't- Like I said, delete my number!
Why are the fuck is you still calling me
Why are you pressed about me fucking on him?


I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)

I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

I've been through the ringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no I ain't a cheater
She hate me when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out her shirt
I'll take her to the cleaner
Love don't end girl if it means no good for me
She's good for me
Too good
These hoes love playing me
Heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me
Just bring me drugs

Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

I told her run around and get away
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout
I need to set another play
I need an umbrella cause every day feels like a rainy day
I need something other than xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California
I'm tryna cut corners
Say they bossing me around
But you know I don't take orders
I had to move around, I was starting to feel cornered
I can't see the front door
Starting to feel cornered
Starting to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screaming out "why bother"
My ex-bitch too bad
My next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash
She ride it like full throttle

I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
So I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

And no I have called you back a billion times
Why can't you answer the phone?
What-(yeah!) I know I'm sorry

Noth- Nothing meant nothing to me! (I gave you everything!)
He didn't mean anything to me
I told you I was there for you
So you just gone give everything I gave you, to someone else?
You just gone give me all away like that?

But I said I really love you!
Okay but I said don't hang up the phone, I really wanna talk to you!


Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin'

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex girlfriend keeps calling my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy show, I show no mercy
With my bros but I got my pole screaming "please don't urge me, please dont urge me," yuh

Screamin please don't urge me

All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy show, I show no mercy
With my bros but I got my pole screaming "please don't urge me, please dont urge me," yuh

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin

God, oh god Waynes
Now we cookin' up (yeah)
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup in her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm mournin' so they textin' me
Ex bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story that's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing
Devil trying to test me, I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts baby looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep I been feeling like a night owl
Music turned up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me so it get lonely at night now

I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup in her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think of the days when I used to undress her


This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, just always
Just faded 'cause I never throw up
Pray to God my plug can pour up
Pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time we tried to rob 'em
He lucky, bro, lil mane fucking off him
I'm drinkin', drivin' in the Bentley coupe so
It's hard for me to drive, move too slow
Told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, anti-hero
I burn my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
I really got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door

This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes

It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moonrock on me, I love the auroma
Get so high that I'm in the clouds with falling angels
These missles halos
She love the coke but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a rollercoaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In the coffin, laying stiff like a board

This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

And it's lean on it, yuh
Purple Rain
So

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking off-white, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time
Molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't give respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine

I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine
But in the meantime
Bitch, it's lean time
Bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time
'Cause it ain't killing me
My Lil bro keep a 40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money, Don't worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime
Bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time
Outta energy
My momma told me "stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me
I'ma be fine

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night

I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine

They know my name, oh wait
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties
I've got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating ramen, with a Glock nine
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she's calling me her next guy

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking off-white, tryna have a fun time

I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Day trip took it to ten

I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

What's the 27 Club? Uh, uh, uh, oh
We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia
So I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out
What the fuck is this 'bout?

I'm tryna make it out
I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out
I'm tryna take the girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends too
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
That hit's for you

I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence

Daytrip took it to ten
Fine, fine

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal and death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing little bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my 13 Reasons Why

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind


From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos

Oh, yeah, I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real
Oh, yeah, life gets tough, shit is getting real
Yeah, I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Not my real feels

Uh, devil standing here tryna make a deal, uh
It ain't no deal, feel like I'm goin' crazy but still it took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in the house on the hills, hills, hills
I didn't have vanity then and I still don't have vanity still, still, still

Bein' me, I rock PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ these drugs
Actin' like mosh pits, squishin' me, oh my
Oh me, how they kill me slowly

Lonely, I've been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I have been looking for signs
But all I can find is the sign of the times

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos

I ain't suicidal
Only thing that's suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to them racks on them niggas, whoa-whoa
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of living in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission

Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos


Stuck in a maze, oh oh oh oh

Stuck in a maze, mmm

Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay
But it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm goin' insane, life's not the same 

Stuck in a maze
And I'm not goin' anywhere
My brain is going everywhere

Sorrows that I been through

I sip ill, pop pills, crack seals
Doin' anything to numb the way that I feel 
Yeah, chase thrills
Used to crashin', Hot Wheels 
Ride a dirt-bike down a ditch, see if I live

I'm not my subconscious, I'm conscious 
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this
I took my demons into the bank of life 
And I made the biggest deposit 
Without drugs I'm losin' my logic 
These pills are my Pro Tools, still got Logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay
But it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm goin' insane, life's not the same

Numb the pain, take these Perc's in the mouth and the nose

And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it


You work numbers, work wonders

I'm the lightening, you're the thunder
There's a difference between "I need you" and "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations
Gettin' a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secret shit you wouldn't even tell Jesus
Uh, our karma been tweakin' so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today

Race
Ring ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong

All day today, same thoughts
This is all the Devil's fault
I ain't mean to name-drop
Often I'll pop all three
I'm off all three
Should I make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Somethin' ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought 'em
Somethin' ain't right with my mind, so I lost it

Drugs turn my knob, then I run like some faucets
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high
It's exhaustin'
I was told it gets better in time

Ring, ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well, no
Go to Hell
"Oh pretty please
Get me these"
"Buy me this"
"Buy me that"
Bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress
I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am high on drugs
And low on sleep?
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high
It's exhausting
I was told it gets better in time

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong

I got me those twins (No cap, on God)
I'm gon' bring them back (No cap, on God)

The way that you lied to me is too fugazi (On God)
No magazines, just fade away

I'm in Japan with the Asian persuasion
Bitches from the Himalayas bringin' me bathin'
Gucci robes like Masons
Fuck her in the Bathing Ape apron
My bitch foreign, I don't know where she from
I ain't tryna be racist

I don't fuck with niggas, I'm racist, uh
Got my dick sucked by a soul-taker
I told her I just want the top
Your clothes don't even take it off
I'm Paul Walker when I'm takin' off
I'm Fast and Furious on you hoes
Unlike you broke-ass niggas, I actually achieved my goals

I'm 'bout to ride
I add her name in my tats
I'm too glittery to ever disguise
I get fed up and fuck her and I ride
Yeah, I ain't gotta try

Got four cars in one shop

Uh, I wanna try, but I

Uh, acidic, a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
I can't disappear and re-appear in the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the pump-packer, the mob thrasher
The purp mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
I straight freak, so high I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak

Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little heaven up in my hell
Yeah, I know it never, ever end well
Yeah, I know I always fall victim to a wish spell, uh
Like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab magnums
Been raw-dogging bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if there's room in heaven for savages
My life's a canvas, I'm painting in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it
Huh, a little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
As someone who ain't got shit but the clothes on they back
And it's been that way since way back since

Like I'm a killer or something
These niggas lip-syncing like Milli Vanilli or something
I'm like Lil Wayne, I got a Milli-Milli-Milli or something
I guess I'm rich and broke, pockets bountiful
My soul's, empty, so deep, 10 feet
Times 10 feet

Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me
That you with me
And not against me
Where I'm from we load it up
Pop out and turn niggas into mince meat


I'm in the studio with Nex and Lotti
Oh yeah, three musketeers
Hey baby

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)

Hold you by your soul
I won't let go
I won't let go

You can bury me with her and if she die before me
Kill me and carry me with her
Know if I die before her, make sure you dyin' a widow
Let's not walk down that road, forever's forever
Eternally attached to her soul
Oh, oh my God
I thank God for her smile
She's too fine, I'm too wild
When I fuck, she taps out
Let's get a house and settle down
Let's have a child, watch him runnin' around
I'm at my all-time high now
You're my sunshine through life's rainclouds

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close so you I'll hold
You by your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go (Go, go, oh)

They tell me life is a riddle,
I found the answers on her tongue in the middle of kissing
I swear to God she can't do wrong
Wonderful tripping, making brash decisions
That's what they tell me but they don't get it, can't grasp the image

Passionate, I'm past bitches, in love with a woman
She past drippy, the Gucci slippers, Versace linens
I'll take her out to dinner, she usually Hibachi grillin'
Poppin' and railin' the last of the Perkies before we kick 'em

You keep my whole, my antidote
You are my dope addicted soul
Addictive soul, that's you my love
Can't get enough, I need to feel your touch
I need to feel your touch
I can't get enough

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close so you I'll hold
You by your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go (Go, go, oh)


Wake up from a dream
She's my every, everything

So I'm sure she's the one for me, me

I can't wait to see the freaky things
She does to me
All her old niggas, they are under me
Back to you, baby, you're a Picasso piece
Yes, indeed
You're lovely and I can't help it
Follow me through the hell and the storm
Honestly, feel like I been here before

'Cause I knew that you are all I need

Wake up from a dream

You ain't dealin' with a rookie
Girl, I'm fresher than the fuckin' Rockies, yo
You be in Jersey like you Snooki
But I know you really came from Philadelph'
Just like Meek Milly, oh
Got my Gucci sweats on
Tryna feel it through the pants, through the drawers
Fuck her good, she sleep it off

Wake up from a dream
She's my every, everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility

I can't go to sleep without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me, me

My paranoia and insecurities hold me close

Let me down asleep with my casket closed
Nail it shut, make sure not to leave a thing exposed
I don't know, oh I don't know
Blonde hair don't care, please don't leave me froze

Stuffed cigarillos and Perc's keep me a hoe
Shoulda shot it in the head, words from my bro
But anything for romance, so I'ma risk it all
Oh oh

Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel

My paranoia and insecurities hold me close

I'm Codeine Cobain, I'm a I'ma pour a four
I don't do cocaine but it's Perc in my nose
I suffer from excessive road rage
Take my life and crash it into this hoe

It don't matter, you can have my heart
Kill me faster, what's mine is yours
On a platter
I watched you grab that dagger
She's a stabber
But is she a rider?
Or is she poison?
A viper?
She gets me high, a supplier
And I'm on fire
Will she be my fire-fighter?

Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real

I don't know, oh I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close


I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless, regardless

So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch then turned herself into a target
Just for talkin' nonsense
Claimin' she was leavin'

Not gonna happen
If I can't have you, no one can
'Cause if you leave, I'm not breathin'
Show you how first to not breathe, breathe

Inhale, exhale
You're the best, well, you're the worst
But you're the best
Hell, I ain't never, ever gonna lose, lose
Tell me what I gotta do to prove to you
Five seconds from losing my head
Now it's time I show you what a lunatics do

She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch then turned herself into a target
Just for talkin' nonsense
Claimin' she was leavin'

Road trip on me

You can sit next to me
Me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk-drivin'
Me, I'm just straight Percules
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
As we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make-believe

My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
As we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make-believe

I heard if you look her in her eyes you might die
Bad bitch, probably make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I got her personified
Don't say her name in the mirror three times
Learned the hard way but that was the last time
Ended my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

I told her that her secret's safe with me
I told her that her love is all I need
Her soul, I'll keep, it helps me sleep
Helps me rest in peace
Don't know where to go, don't know where I've been
I been too high off [?]
Lord knows I don't got any other friends
I befriended the drugs again
I fell in love with the plug again
I pulled it under the rug again
I'm drowning in a cup full of mud again
Cross my heart and hope I don't give in

I heard if you look her in her eyes you might die
Bad bitch, probably make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I got her personified
Don't say her name in the mirror three times
Learned the hard way but that was the last time
Ended my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Percocet in my vitals, oh

Codeine got a nigga mind froze
Codeine got a nigga time slowed
The devil in the red dress kills
It told me not to take the red pill
I took the red pill and the blue pill
Last night was too real

I heard if you look her in her eyes you might die
Bad bitch, probably make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I got her personified
Don't say her name in the mirror three times
Learned the hard way but that was the last time
Ended my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Now I'm seein' double, seein' two, seein' two
I feel like a ghost when I look at you, peek-a-boo
I get so damn high, I don't know what to do, up to you
You could be my lover and my drug too

Mega, you played that boy


They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

[Juice WRLD:]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

[Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty:]
Hey, these girls are insane (Lil Boat)

[Lil Yachty:]
Shoutout Megan, make a nigga cum in two seconds
It was all good til' no one wanted see me with it
Janet, shawty hair from a different planet
Cool as fuck but I can't trust a soul, God damn it
Jasmine, probably taking pictures out in Aspen
High school, back in high school, she couldn't stand me
These girls are the same
That's why I fuck 'em all the same, my brother
Drop my top in the rain (skr)
No one feels my pain but my brothers
VVS my veins
Ice cold blood can't relate to no lover
Please don't go insane
Over these raggedy hoes, my brother
Hundred thousand dollars on a rain coat
Niggas steady hatin', call them Big Joe
30 karats hangin' off my pinky toe
Asking all them questions, why you wanna know?
Shawty wanted drugs so I made it snow
Walking around askin' folks where the blow (Lil Boat)

[Juice WRLD with Lil Yachty:]
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane (oh, no)
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love

[Lil Yachty:]
The same, love
All these hoes the same, love

[*dogs barking*]
Cute dog
Purps on the beat
She got dogs and shit in the background, mute yo self
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I tell her a-na-a-na-a-na

Her voice sounds like a stereo and it's up in my head
When she is not around it feels like I'ma turn up dead
I'm calling on her phone telling her I'm full of dread
I wish that she was here, playing in my dreads
She told me she really likes me, I hope its not a fib
I told myself I wouldn't even go through the same shit again
She runnin' runnin' through my head like a race she tryna win
But she don't know that she don't got no competition
I'm in Paris by myself it feels like something's missin'
Ex girl on my phone, bitch why is you trippin'?
Leave me alone I done moved on to somethin' different
I'm finally gettin' the feeling I was missin'
Uh, you came in like a hurricane
You tell me you ain't playin' at all, still tryna figure out the games
Maybe there ain't no games to play in the first place
Maybe you a real one, we gon' see
Oh, and me? I'm real as can be
I want to eat your heart out figuratively
I've been feelin' different since you've been away from me
I'm tempted to get too high
And me? I'm real as can be

Ain't scared to bring the poles out you know how I roll out
But I got a soft spot for the girl that makes my heart drop
Uh, poles out you know how I roll out
Yeah I got a soft spot for the girl that makes my heart drop
I'll go all out, yeah I'll go all out
I'll go all out, yeah I'll go all out
Gucci on your wrist you ain't think I've seen it
I wish you was here everything is scenic
Having chest pains feelin' like I'm endin'
This is real life I am not pretendin'
Cupid got a gun at my head, finna pull it
I'ma stand here and take it ain't dodgin' bullets
This seems too good be to true, what's to it?
You told me that there ain't nothin' to it but to do it

My homie asked "What's next?" Do I like her, do I love her, do I want her?
I wonder if I give her my heart am I a goner?
She keep Backwoods rolled, she a stoner, she a stoner
Tattoos on her face, I kiss her ink under covers
Uh, get my tongue involved, she got me in awe baby
Give me it all, uh, feel it in my draws baby
All night long, you deserve an applause baby
Made me a better person already I didn't involve, baby
Tell me why my old hoes still tryna be involved, baby
I feel like you should load it up and shoot 'em in the jaw, baby
I was off the Xannies, calling your phone, feeling wrong, baby

Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your stuff, run away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

Take one perc, 30 to the face
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang, is it a problem today
They don't catch feelings, but they'll catch them a case
Took your bitch to Cali, you take L's in LA
I just want the Rolly, with the diamonds in the face
Glizzy and the Goyard, [?] on my waist
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray
I put codeine [?], money gangster, pourin' up
If I tell him you a problem, he gon' fuck you up
He told me nothing gettin' between us and these fuckin' bucks
We gon' run it up, we gon' run it up
So much cash, we gon' need a dump truck
Tryna rob me, you such a dumb fuck
That bitch say she love me, she such a dumb slut
Say he wanna kill me, lil nigga what's up?

Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement

Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your stuff, run away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

You'll probably kill me if you had the chance, huh
Probably cause I spent a couple thou on pants, huh
Probably cause I got your bitch to dirty dance, huh
Fuck her then I'll leave her, call me Dirty Dan, huh
She scratch her head, like she got dandruff
You is my son, like my name Sanford
Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banners
I ain't Megaman, but I got two cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Said she had fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white hoe

Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day
Remember writin' raps in my basement
Now I'm up in Cali, every day a vacation
Still takin' drugs to the face
Pills full of thrills, take your stuff, run away

It's probably 'cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably 'cause I'm livin' and I'm in a lower place
They walkin' in their slums while I'm vibin' outer space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams, and when you reach them celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

There's snakes in the grass, with my John Deer helmet see the serpents
God gave me this sermon, he told me I earned it
Looking at the bridges that I'm tryna rebuild

I'ma get this cash, best believe that I'm spendin' it
Then I'm getting it back
Bobby Brown up in the trap, from the way I'm spitting this crack
Nigga, to be exact my flow is off of the map
Every time that I spit all these niggas toppin' they hats
Sayin' I am the mannequin
Nigga's faking it, they mannequins
Walk in the sky like I'm Anakin

People thinking they understand but they really can't comprehend

"I don't think I've met anyone like you in my life, bro. It's been real. Wow."
"Thank you, bro."
"That, I was struggling to come up with words. I didn't even know I could do that, I couldn't even think of words. You were comin' up with whole songs, and I was strugglin', [?] what could I say, aho. We'll do one more?"

"What-What... Was that caramel?"
"Uh?"
"That's caramel?"

Listen to the next project you better buy it (Mm)
It's gon' be the realest shit you heard, I ain't lyin'
It's gon' be the realest shit you heard, I ain't lyin' (Yeah!)
I'm defyin' 2012, and it's real like the Mayans
Kill every beat and I ain't even really tryin'
I'ma tell the truth, no frontin', no lyin'
I bop to survive, my flow is the hottest
The highest, the fliest
Flyer than a pilot, my gun a library and it got a silence
But I still want Santa-ty in a piece, so
So I'll do anything to kill all the violence
But back in Chicago is bustin'
Niggas really shooting guns like the shit is nothing
Killing mom's kids and children, but this shit is disgusting
We gon' need more than a talk, more than a discussion
All I know is get the cash, yeah, get the cash
Catch up, tell them niggas, "Catch up"
They gon' need some backup
Remember hittin' stains like mustard and ketchup
Now I'm 200 MPH, they won't catch us
If you can, but you can't
I'm the motherfucking champ
You ain't Triple 9, then fuck you, get the fuck out my camp
Niggas thinking that they in it
They always come and doubt until I ball like a warrior
Switch up like I'm Durant
I'm a shoot from the three, niggas can't fuck with me
Not with the fuckery
Hotter than the summer be
Niggas really think they spell it out
But I'ma spell it clearly
Like a nigga gettin' an "A" and doing a fucking spelling bee

"Ay! Juice WRLD in the building!"

Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again
We needed a vacation, so I took a trip to France
I just spent 2000 on a shirt and a pair of pants
If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' Perkies, that's my baby, love the 'Xans
Had to cover up, couldn't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in

Look at me now like Chris Brown
I'm a king, that's my queen, better bow down
All the hoes on my line 'cause I'm up now, yeah
Come through when she's not around, yeah
I'm just playing, bae, you know I'm here to stay
This is real love, I ain't here to play
I need real drugs, not the fake Perks, but the real ones
I remember I was caught up in my feelings
All these women starting to look like evil villains
Baby, you a hero, you're so different
Had to put the drug talk down for a minute
Listen, this bitch got me tripping

You brought meaning to my life, all because of you I do right
Because of you, I have a purpose
Fight for the world because you're worth it

Wedding bells, ringing hell, frozen
Wishing wells, killing my wishes
I'm the worst, the baddest
Since the creation of cancer
I'm the worst, the baddest
Searchin' far and wide for some answers
Until then, I don't get no pics
In this building the demons look for me
I'ma fish, watch 'em reel in
That's just the way I been feelin'

I'm fightin' off the demons in my sleep (Uh)
I pray to God my soul is his to keep

Drowns me in my misery
Cuts me deep, makes me bleed
I'm ten feet at the cemetery
Maybe it's all in my head, yeah
Maybe I just need rest, yeah
Lately, I been stressed
Tryna impress the whole world
I'm lost in a cold world

'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So everytime
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah [x2]

Will I see better days? I don't know
Bet you never seen a frown like this before
I was told to always look at things a lil different
See my demons through kaleidoscopes
Here goes some advice I found
Say it with me, scream it loud
Don't let nothing bring you down
And out, and out

'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So everytime
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah [x4]

I tell her that she thinks too much
I ain't ever give no fucks
So I'ma go and pour me up


Lost
I lost, I lost
I lost, I lost

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

Welcome to my abyss
Filled with sins and trifiling
Fake friends, I hate them
Delete them all, erase them
I'm getting lost in my abyss
Trials, stipulations and suffering
Mayhem will break them
Words from the evil faces

Drugs will fade them (Away)
Pop three I face them (Away, away, away)
Welcome to my abyss (Welcome, welcome, welcome)
Pain and suffering (Welcome, welcome, welcome)

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

It's pain in those words, you can hear it when I talk
But whats a life to live if you ain't got no risk involved?
And whats a slit to make if you ain't got no wrist involved?
Mixin' pills with the liquor, fuck, I'm finna risk it all
Still a cool dude, too smoth, just like olive oil
Known to pop pills, pop niggas and pop ollies, boy
And pop wheelies, ghost ride it, my mind is enlightened
I'm highest, the highest, don't need no ghost writer
Bitch I speak for myself, but my health ain't my wealth
'Cause I'm rich in my bank, but I'm bad with myself
Bombin' like a kamikaze, I'm the shit to these hoes
I set the play, these niggas flock, they settin' picks for me, ho
I came in killin', I'm really fuckin' the industry up
These niggas shady, they really leavin' me mentally fucked
Trapped inside the abyss with a bad bitch in the front
With a blunt in my mouth and some purple codeine in the cup

Way spazzin' on they asses in all type of ways
Pop a couple Percs to take my life away
Nah, just a lighter day, just a brighter day
She doin' all the lines, she had a whiter day
Freestylin', no writers, ayy
That mean when the songs come out I get paid
No cuts, give no fucks
I show out before I even go and show up

So what? I drink Henny till I throw up
So what? It's red lean in that white cup
Pull up on 'em like beep, that's a tow truck
Choppa on me like damn, nigga, don't duck
Duck, goose when I catch 'em
Niggas askin' questions, stop throwin' hatchets
Never had a father, always been a bastard
Fuck with me I'll beat your ass, your head is in a plaster
They don't make sense like spelling rich backwards, I'm madder
Run up, that's okay your head is on a platter
Outta space off the codeine, I'm on Saturn
Niggas got it backwards, dyslexic patterns
I don't believe in you niggas, a nigga athiest
Say this I spray it, say it don't spray it
I'll spray it don't say it, presidential brain from your main, S. Pailin
Pull up on the scene, judge a nigga no bailiff
Flow go cold, shine like VVS, nigga fuck rose gold
It's like 50k inside my wardrobe
I get new bitches, these niggas fuck worn hoes
You a whore, ho, you know it, I don't gotta say it
Pull up on the scene, my choppa just like Alizé
Pop it like a bottle, I fuck on a model
I don't wanna fuck if that bitch don't plan to swallow
I told her boyfriend he could swallow all the hollows
Don't believe me, send your location I'll be there tomorrow

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace


O.K. Let's skate
Bad bitch finna come my way

What's a god without a goddess, so I need me a goddess
Fuck being humble shit I'm done being modest

Catch this chopper into yo intestines
Mic check 1-2 testin
Pull up on the scene slim wrestlin

Young Rich Nigga, that's a guarantee

No Dahmer, I'm a problem
You a goon cool, I got goblins
Fuck with me, make you leak like a faucet
Mix the liquor up, skrt now I'm nauseous
I don't sip the lean, used to love codeine cause I love to dream
Now mix henny with the remmy, cause I love to drink
And I don't love to think
Feel like I'm finna puke
Can't do it on the mink, me
Money on the way, what is the, hold up, hold up

Nineteen, multi-millionaire
Ain't no lookin' back, all that broke shit there

Money on me, hunnid on me
Bro gon' catch a body, then he flee the scene
I still put the G-Star on my jeans
She ask me if I love her, only in her dreams

Young Rich Nigga, that's a guarantee
Ugly, but I'm killer like Jeffery

You run up on me, you gone, that choppa' on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo' dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me
Off the Xannies, I'm a zombie
Don't believe me, try me, fuck around, stomp you
I'm kinda hungry off the weed, I may chomp you
And that shorty, she a eater, she a muncher
Man I'm feeling like a monster
Straight Jeffrey Dahmer when I'm grippin' the Llama
You don't want problems, no smoke at all
I take your whole pound and smoke it all

You run up on me, get popped, they judge a nigga like Cochran
They forgot to stop it, run up on me here
I got a rocket on me, no launcher
I feel like I am the bestest, I'm deadlier than asbestos
My word is really my weapon, I'm coming back for some seconds
Freestylin's a preference, send you to stairway to heaven
Man, these niggas writin' the shit that I say
The beats beat when I'm beatin' like Doctor the Dre
I pull up on them with the choppa', and screamin' out "Hey!

Still sellin' John McCain, like you got yo shit snatched
My flow is off the chain, pull up in the rover, yeah I got the range
I feel like Drake, nothing was the same
Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion
I rush out with yo girl, she fuck for hours up in the shower
I feel like I got superpowers, I'm so superb
I'm bout the action, you niggas bout action verbs
I don't gotta say a word, I shoot for the green, feelin' like Larry Bird
On the competition, I drop and take a turd
Shove it in they ears, they hearin' every word
Really though, I get it poppin' like a nigga hittin' wheelies hoe
Or an ollie hoe, or a molly hoe
Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley hoe
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf
You want to go to heaven so bad, here's a halo
My gun sing like J Lo, you better get low like limbo
Before you catch a couple shots for yo kinfolk
I'm Rambo with the ammo, I don't never let go
Money kinda stick to me, call me Juice Velcro
Say you gettin' money now, fuck nigga hell no
You don't like Adidas but this choppa give you shell toes
This choppa' give you shell toes
And leave yo ass dancin' on the floor like a red nose
Beam on my gun, that's a red nose
Pull up on the scene, let the shit blow
Yonkers, Yonkers, in this bitch with Westwood, man

Got a brand new gun, it got a Major Lazer

Off the dome shit, smoke creative, anyways
You late to the party, have you belated
And if you want smoke, leave you cremated anyday
Put the bullet holes, in his windshield
Even if I'm havin' a bad day, I win still
Wake up, pray to god
Even thought that I sin still
Devil weighin' on my shoulders, like an anvil
Perky got a nigga itchin' uhh, ant hill
Fuck that bitch, then put her on my ad libs
You happy fake, bitch I'm mad real
Make that choppa masturbate, like a porn film

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
(Chopsquad)
999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain, with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line I talked to addiction
Huh, speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I missed them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Something feels broke need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide them
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain, with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real, if it wasn't for the pills I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
They took the wheel and then they drove me crazy
Got me reminiscing, hyperventilating
Prescriptions like a doctor, never been a patient
Never had the patience for this crazy shit

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain, with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Can't live in the past time
Looking at the future on my own

Looking in the future, all mine
Searching for the shit you can't find
She gone let me fuck I'm inside
Ain't run from nothing, no high
I ain't feeling low I'm too high
Bad bitch and she came from Dubai
Only took me two tries
(One two, one two)

Let me talk my shit
Let me spark my blunt
Let me pour my fifth
You can't talk like this
You can't walk like this
Now they're on my dick
Rose gold
My watch look like piss
Everybody loves Juice
Everybody hates Chris
Water on my wrist
Probably fucking your bitch
Silly rabbit tricks are for kids
Aye
Talk my, talk my
Talk my shit
Let me talk my shit
Let me talk my talk
Hey


Uh, I wake up in the morning feel amazing
Hit-Boy
Wake up, huh
[?]

I wake up in the morning, feel amazing, it's amazing
Getting faded on the daily, run to the cash, it ain't no waiting
Taking these Percocets, they turn me like pages
I'm getting so high, like I'm going through phases
Yeah, I know these bitches crazy, still wanna have my baby
When she get me started, no I can't stop
She took my heart and put it in a lock box
How I'm the famous nigga, but I'm fanned out
She the type to make a nigga jaw drop

Uh, straight to the floor I mean it
Percocet pop, the opposite of speeding
She came from heaven, opposite of demon
Yeah we got a lot of disagreements
Disagreements got me fiending
She's unique, her uniqueness got me to the point where I can't speak
Aw, in love, fallen
She got game, Michael Jordan
She ride me like a horse, Ralph Lauren
She ride me like a whore and I love it
Oh oh scoring
She is everything but boring
And if she ever leaves, I'm forced in enormous torment

I wake up in the morning, feel amazing, it's amazing
Getting faded on the daily, run to the cash, it ain't no waiting
Taking these Percocets, they turn me like pages
I'm getting so high, like I'm going through phases
Yeah, I know these bitches crazy, still wanna have my baby
When she get me started, no I can't stop
She took my heart and put it in a lock box
How I'm the famous nigga, but I'm fanned out
She the type to make a nigga jaw drop

You've been on my mind, since we first met

Heartbreak girl, we beyond that
Just be honest
The sorrow and the pain, I can't digest
Take my time, got no time left
Take my heart, all of my love
Just don't waste it
I was always scared to go find love
Waiting on cupid, to find us
But I'm on life in the hourglass, time up

Lean put me down, but it's fillin' me up
Fallin' to the ground, shit is tearin' me up
I'm fucked up
I tried [?], now I care so much
When I wake up, and I see that you're gone
Got me doin' drugs, walkin' into my room
Dear lost love, Dear lost love, Dear lost love
Got me doin' drugs, walkin' into my room

My life in a nutshell
This is my life in a nutshell

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal (fuck)

Back in the lost and found, I go but I'm more lost than found
I know, I feel so cold in LA like I'm sitting back at home, Chicago
They say living's harder than dying, I'm willing to gamble that
Find me unresponsive, in a hotel room, girl can you handle that
Worst case scenario, you still hear my songs on the stereo
You still hear my name on the radio
I'll live forever, forever

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal

(Oooooh, ooh, oooooh, ooooh)
Death melodies I sing, cardiac arrest knows
I hate to bring the negative vibes in the room
But that's the ugly truth
So much of my life, and time the world's consumed
I'll throw the duse, and grab the noose
Onto the next chapter, none of this matters
I been feeling helpless

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal

Too many ups and downs, this a rollercoast'
I was born to drown, I was born hell-bound
My back to the world as it all burns down
Yeah, my heart was good, until I found out
Ain't no such thing as good anymore

Being optimistic is a waste of time, uh
One thing about time, you ain't wasting mine
Ain't no saving me, I know my heart cold
Blame it on the weather and the narcos
Take my breath, take my heart, take my soul, nothing left
I got cash, but I can't take that with me after death
You can't tell, bitch, I'm stressed, I been feeling like a mess
I been feeling like a wreck, 911, I'm in distress
There's a hole in my chest

 Next thing you know I'm on a dinner date, straight to hell 
Funny thing is this not my first time here 
I've been here so much, I'm really startin' to like hell
 Toxic relationships got me killin' myself
 On the phone with a therapist, bitch I need me some help

 Shorty play me like piana maestro
 I was taught to let live and let go
 I don't trust you, they gon' shoot you, they treat me like Metro

Hey, Rvssian
Ain't nothin' but a-
Uh, no good woman
No good, diamond watchin' woman
Uh

She ain't nothin but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Momma told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opioids openly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah

One thing you need to know about me is
All I ever wanted was love and money, yeah
One thing you need to know about me is
This rock-star life turned me to a junkie
Another thing you need to know about me is
I'm full of addictions, this is just vindictive
Subject a lil' sensitive, maybe I should just shallow it
Went from talkin' to 'pression to money-makin' prerogative
Still a smart guy, could've got a scholarship
Sayin' fuck college, I'ma tell you how I started it
It took one phone call from G-Money, that's my dawg
Turned me from a twenty dollar nigga to millions in my drawers
This song's about all my talents and vices (Oh-oh)
Listen repeatedly, scream it, recite it (Oh-oh)
Until it piss your father off, he already pissed though (Oh-oh)
I know, 'cause his daughter on my tour givin' deep-throat (Yeah yeah yeah)
This song's about all my talents and vices (Oh-oh)
Listen repeatedly, scream it, recite it (Oh-oh)
Yo' girl give me fellatio, you should be excited (Oh-oh)

I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout drugs, the weed and the pills
I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout music and hoes, right?
And clothes, I was overly exposed
Now I'm bein' the fruits, my momma planet didn't growed

Hell yeah, I done glowed up, I done glowed up
Oxycodin got me so'ed up, gotta remain focus
And these groupie hoes bogus, everybody knows it
But they turn me to a poet, with the love commotion
Blood, sweat and tears, money partied it in Moses
Used to roam it, now it's gas, what I'm smokin'
Like I farted, hit the gas, I'm in motion
Out, departed, wrist hangin' out the window, cost yo apartment
This the brightest that my life ever been, I need diamonds all over for when it get dark again
I call my momma up and tell her the devil marchin' in
She sent me bible verses, then I got distracted by some news from a sex worker
Who am I to not text back? That's network
Who am I to lie about my life? I know the truth hurts
Who am I to say that this ain't one of my best verses?
Uh-oh, too bad

She ain't nothin but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Momma told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember

New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't know me, know me)

They sing the right songs they just hit the wrong notes
Remember old days when I had my heart broke
And now I'm in the stu and I love to spit dope
Brought brother in the trap and he love to fix dope
These niggas never change I could never fix broke (Fix broke)

You don't get no birds like a fucking scarecrow

She told me she in love with the old me
But I don't love the old me
In the fourth quarter balling like Kobe
I'm super clutch just like Ginóbili
Time is money so I went and got a rollie
New girl looking like a trophy
She do the cocaine till her nose bleed (Nose bleed, nose bleed)
And she don't even know me (And she don't even know me, know me)

I don't love the old me
Balling like Kobe

Man, oh, man, that's when I woke up again
It was a dream in a dream, reality ain't my friend, mmh
Man, oh, man, time to get fucked up again

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I woke up to see your face, but I forgot that you're not there
It's kinda crazy, ain't it complicated? Love, it got me scared
The nights are slumberless
Some toss and turn and thinkin' about my life
And where I went wrong and took that left turn
It feels like I can never do right

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

Just wanna let you know I love you, but

When you, put me down
So easily, I frown
Your words, they haunt my mind
But I'll lie and say I'm fine
When you, put me down
So easily, I frown
But I need you in my life
Our souls are intertwined

Baby you know that you got a knife on your tongue
Cut away at everything that I bask in
Downplay my thoughts and all of my opinions
So much for being repetitive
You say the perfect things, to make me feel like
I'm not enough for you
It kinda sucks cause, I am in love with you
You make me feel so damn uncomfortable to tell you how I feel
But I want this for real
Not a faker
Kinda scared to tame my problems, you seem abrasive
Run away from all of the drama, I've been evasive
Still thinkin' bout it on a daily basis


The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines (skrrt)
The race is beginnin'
Everybody push to start their engines
Red light, yellow light, Go!
Red light, yellow light, Go

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today, (ring, ring, ring me)

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own, freezing all night long
Can't tell what's real, or where I belong

Uh, day to day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault, I need an angel
Often, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
So many fours like the rings on my Audi

Xans with the Everclear got me seeing foggy
I wonder how something clear got me seeing foggy
Somethin' ain't right bout' the pills but I bought em'
Somethin' ain't right with my mind so I lost it

Drugs turn my knob to the right that's a faucet
But it ain't water it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of getting high it's exhaustin'
I was told it'd get better with time (ring, ring, ring me)

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own, freezing all night long
Can't tell what's real, or where I belong


I wanna tell y'all a story about this girl I met
I don't know if it was in person, or if it was in one of my dreams
But she'd have been a rockstar tonight

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
I'm racing her to hell
I don't really know her
Would I know her well enough, to know?

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her hips
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar, forreal
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know

I don't really know her well but I know her
All she wanna do is live in the moment
Pick up the pills and mix up the potions
Get high, forreal, she not with the posin'
All she ever wanna do is molly in the ocean!
I met her in Hollywood and I knew she was poison
She told me take two of these and call her in the morning
I ain't been the same since, I know when you take that road
You can't go back, ooh, my heart cold and she know that too
You play your role, and I'll play my games, we could role that dice
But know, I won't lose, no, I won't lose, you could pick and choose
It don't matter what I do, I just wanna be a rockstar like you!

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar

I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know

I don't really know her well... but I know her

She love all my Givenchy, she wear it up
She still running, from my love
Got the demons on me, I'm below high
And I'm done running, from the drugs
But they still running, from my gun, right
Club life, drug life, saw her in the club light
She a killer in the white shirt, that's that off white
How you finna ball on my turf, that shit offsides
She told me that if I took the right drugs, then I won't die

Don't believe in sunshine, I'm a night guy
I lied when I told her I was Mr. Nice guy
Rockstar status, in the cut, with some Molly missin'
And you know that they dirty dancin' for the dope
She said she gon' suck me up until the bitch choke
Bitch I'm Danny Phantom, with the ghost
Pull up in a Phantom, like a ghost, right
Young rich, handsome, did the most, huh
Pop it like Champaigne, she tryna have a toast, right

Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I made you go get some more, more

Say she want my heart, she can't afford it
Maybe cause I'm on my way to getting on the Forbes list
Pretty Jiggy nigga, can't ignore it
Ballin' bitch, I feel like Michael Jordan
Sip Codeine, I'm snorin
Til' the mornin'
Got the heater on my hip, like global warmin'
Run up you get shot, this is a warnin'
Freddy Kruger in your dreams, I'm filled with torment
She say that she love my bitch, whatever that means
I remember her and our friends were laughin' at me
Now they tell me I can fuck, that shit so funny to me
Lost 10 thousand playin' basketball, 100 to me

Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I made you go get some more, more

The song

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

Uh, digest, digest
This lil' heart of mine, I won't let you smash it
Burn me up inside, turn me into ashes (Uh)
Why, why?
This lil' soul of mine, won't let it get intertwined (Uh)
With somebody I, always fail to realize that
They were never mine, they were never ever mine
I was just a part in her pics, they get processed
This lil' soul of mine, won't let you get control of mine (Uh)
Won't let you control my mind (Yeah), I gotta keep that mindset
This lil' soul of mine, won't let you control mine
Oh, now you wanna stay and work it out, not this time

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you


Yeah
We're
Laying in bed
You see the
I lock eyes
Our eyes lock

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm off the percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love, 'til we die
Let's fuck until we slump over

Be my first, I, know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
This a conversation not a love song

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I wanna know
Is it gon' be forever, or temporary?
If you leave, it'll hurt, keep the tissue ready
Got the drugs on the table, I'm ready
I put Rick on your slippers, no Cinderella
Remember when you went to the fortune teller
She told you, we need each other
Hah, what if she trippin?
I'm just kiddin'
Back to the main focus
I think that you're gorgeous
You love the way that I stroke it
Signin' my name on your neck
You used to make potions
Playin' round with Witchcraft
I wonder if you'll put that in my lean and I'll drink that

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

We met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart when she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm here to serve a purpose
Girl I know I ain't picture perfect
One more thing I know for certain
If you leave I'll close the curtains

I'm the best to ever do it, have ’em leakin' body fluids
Feel like Waka Flocka "O Let's Do It" when I'm on this music
Off the dome when I’m kickin' it
Kinda like I got an impediment when I'm spittin' it

Lord forgive me on this mic, 'cause I know I'm finna sin
Killin' him, him, and him, referencin' Eminem
All these other rappers ain't shit but thinnin' in

They can have a penny cause I don't really have a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch

Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me that's okay, that choppa on me get the Jumpman

Your girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah I said it and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, and get high on this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
Dude, I do that shit on purpose, suicide in that bitch
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche
We kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck yo bitch on camera and call that shit a hardcore
Hard porn, Sharper than hard poons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so they choppas actin' like brooms
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon
Pull up on the scene, that's just me
Hey, switch that shit up real quick
I may come back to that, I don't know


I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

I told her that her secret safe with me
I told her that her loveis all I need
Her soul, I'll keep it, helps me sleep
Helps me Rest In Peace
I've been to high off [?]
Lord knows I don't got any other friends
I befriended the drugs again
I fell in love with the plug again
I put it under the rug again
I'm drownin' in a cup full of mud again
Cross my heart and hope I don't give in

I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Ooh, ooh
What do I do, this shit's so suicidal
Percocets, in my vitals
Bible of the rival, that's all I know
Codeine got a nigga mind froze
Codeine got a nigga time slow
The devil in the red dress kills
They told me not to take the red pill
I took the red pill and the blue pill
Last night was to real

I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

I'm faster than sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses, I got it
Run up on me, I'm poppin'

For yo brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' that target
I'll turn yo ass to a target then threw yo ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin'
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate", nah
I did this all by myself so I don't need nobody's help, shit
I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel
You can catch 20 shells, you a fat person, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, Seinfeld
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my 40, it came from my plaster
That shit is a blessing, I leave you in the past tense
I rap to wrappin' plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outta space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, yo bitch in my left hand
And her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it'll come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pant pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside the clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me cause it go, oof!
Next beat, next beat, I may come back
Next part, what should I kill? Cool


I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing, love, you're my everything

It's funny when they tell me I'm a sad boy
Then why you think I'm using all the drugs for
Cracked a Benz while I'm lookin' to the Benz track, (ha)
I won't be sad no more
Somewhere down the line I'll meet a sad girl
Next thing you know she in my bed
Next thing you know she in my room
Next thing you know she in my head

Let's add a little drama to the scene
This is when I tell you that I love you when you leave
This is when you told me that I don't mean anything
Then that's where I told you that you were my everything

I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing, love, your my everything

Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him

Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on?, I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acappella
I could give you want you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me, see me smoke a million (SESH)

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you Is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty I wish to explore your features secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you back to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got no where to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'


I know that it hurts sometimes, but It's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wan' see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feeling philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, will you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
Comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room


You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why

Ohhhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Noooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhhh, fuck is you talkin' bout my shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole for eternity so they can reap what they sow
Ohhhh, I don't think I can do nothing but flow
Noooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhhh, I don't know why you in love with me hoe
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why


I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So lets laugh a little 'fore I'm gone
I've been dreaming of this shit for awhile now
Got me high now
She don't love me but she's singing my song
Oh no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walking home alone I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it getting high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high I be fucking with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the morning with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

Running away from me but I'm not giving up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me but I'm not giving up on you no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things


Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You weren't there
(Skrrt)

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all

Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for it


I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me
Now you acting like a ghost and that's okay I know I'm ugly
Now I'm swerving in the ghost and I'm okay I'm getting money
Now I'm switching up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothing
Give me some time and give me your patience
Came in the game last one month, fuck the game I'm done
Give me a sign and I'm going to take it
Whatever way I want
Bitch I get payed up front
I'm getting mine so fuck all your placements
Baby face I'm done
Fuck the place I'm from
Don't hit my line and say something basic
If it ain't about the money
Please don't waste no time
Looking out the edge, and I'm picturing the fall
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Put it in my bong then I make another song


Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

Don't stutter, slang from the gutter, gotta' bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shining thru' the shutter
Say she over me, whatever cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad, you don't, you won't, not never,
Stop blowing up my phone

You wanna run that shit back for me?

Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers


I use to dream of you
Na,I use to lose my sleep for you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck witchu
I use to scream at you
I use to turn my cheek at you
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck bout me
And I ain't nothing to you
I'm just looking at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain,But I don't never complain
I'm insane I'm deranged,I see your face at the rain
This ain't no race for the fame,But at this pace I'ma make it
Face it,you basic, Lil Peep you're replacement
I'm taking your spot
I'll give it back when I'm raking the gwap
Maybe not
I keep on checking statements
I'm checking for payments
While you checking ya plays bitch

I been doing my own thing lately
I been holdin my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They  asking me how it feel,I say it's crazy
[x2]


When I'm coming down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again..

If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breaking down again..

But if I need to go
Just to show you I don't fucking care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
And I won't fucking stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you..

You notice me [x4]
You know its me [x4]

It's me

My arms are searching for you
My arms are stretched out towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you


Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl
I'm all on my own
I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this
Putting my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flying bitch
Breaking my bones
You breaking my bones you want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me cause it help me forget
I ain't go put up no time
If you ain't got time if I ain't gon' bitch
I'm doing my thing
and bitch I can see all the disrespect in front of my face
Step in this bitch let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smoking on something imo dip
Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I need you
I wont pick up the phone
Just know that I need you


Laying on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, tryna take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thracks, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwing shade like you finna face me
You were always bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch I got plenty in my bottle it say Remy on my belt
That shit say Fetti in the back, green (bling)

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb cause they give me all their brains

Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Driving fast when she listening to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime pussy make me happy

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins


Damn son, where'd you find this?

Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make her frumpet cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
Get my face recognised
We can do anything
Worth, greed, memory
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make a grown man cry cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wanna be


Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice put the blame on you

(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death)
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice then its shame on u

Where did you go this time
What if I lose my mind
What if I make you cry
What if I die
What if I end my fucking life


I'mma take my time when I'm in it
I'mma make my mind up by tonight
No I can't die when I'm singing
I could live forever, way past the mic

These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony


I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money getting tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't picking up a call, mirror on the wall

I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall


[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
She said she ain't never coming back
She ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put u on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than..
See you leave just like the rest..
(See you leave just like the rest..)
Damn..

[Yung Goth:]
Lately, I've been dying lately

Lately, lately..

I've been dying lately, lately, lately
I've been dying lately
Gettin high lately
Gettin high lately
Lately, baby

Always tryna blame me
You ain't tryna save me
Save me, lately
Gettin high, tasty
Now I'm on that same shit
I've been dying lately
Lately, baby

[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down


[Lil Skil:]
I can see it in your eyes, that u wanna get high
I can see it in your eyes, that u need it right now
How you need it right now
How you wanna get high
How you need it right now
How you wanna good bye..

[Lil Skil & Lil Peep:]
I just wanna hear a sign from the narrow side of town
Baby we grillin' right now (woah)
Yeah I just wanna feel alive, baby take your time
Smoking on the spot (woah)

[Lil Peep:]
Girl you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me that's the best part baby the trust
Trust me
I got nothing for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie till the sun came up
All the places that you took me no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me now they on my nuts


My time is here and I'm making it clear
Oh I love you my dear
But I'm going, I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die I'mma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time but I never wanna do that again
Nothing worse than losing a friend
And the feeling you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waiting for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all


I been spending time
Time after time
Tryna get my mind right
But I just find I been lyin
Lying to myself
I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own
Baby I could handle mine
I could multiply..
I could satisfy..
Anybody tryn' see me shine
Man that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind
You been on my line
That's the reason why
I been working hard
You could stand aside
I could never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe

That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe [x2]


Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD

I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
But you got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burning down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(baby I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream

That I still love u like I did back in two thousand and eight

Yeah It's true
Girl I think I'm dying real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Ima keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wasting my time
Giving you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin truck out (skrr)
Trying to buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

Let me bleed, watch me die
I got golden teeth, she got bright green eyes
She's my fantasy, she only comes at night
She don't know 'bout me, what goes on inside
I'll let you feel my pain if you would get me high
Had to make my name, I had to break my spine
Now I'm on my way, I'm just lookin' for pain
Bitches fuck me the same, it don't matter the place, okay

I just wanna die by my momma side
Tell her that I love her while my brother cry
I don't got the time for no compromise
Bitch, I need it all, I'ma make it mine

Disappear into my mind where I can't feel a thing
When the sky falls down, no one here can think that clearly
I'll be by your side, let's get high one last time

I don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now
But I gotta leave it alone
Is it cause I'm hot now, it's probably cause I'm hot now
Bitch you better leave me alone
First I cut you off then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around
I don't never come around

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speeding down the highway, looking at the street lights
Geeking on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowing I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I should've curved you, I know I'm the worst boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe I swear she love getting high to
I love getting high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm making music to cry too

I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you acting like a ghost girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights getting high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone
I'm dying, I don't think that my bitch know

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same

Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna come back to you
I know, I did a little blow and I never wrote back to you
My love, I wanna give it all to you
Baby I just wanna ball with you
I could see the air was coming near the way I do
About you now

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same


[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal:]
Running up that hill, you pushin' me back
Think that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Because I don't know (I dunno)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
Fore me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It's the way, it is the way it really seem
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passing on and out
(And out, and out)
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt

[Lil Peep:]
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn't something 'til you brought it up
I knew that you were trying to make it out
Without a single scar, clawing at my arm
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbing on top of me
Why you acting like you fucking forgot me?
I've been dreaming about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I'm moving to Hollywood


Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first

Lying on the asphalt, Lil Peep blacked out
Fucking with the coatway, let my Mad Max out
I be on some real shit, get it from my OG
I don't wanna hear shit, shawty what she told me
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I be on my lonely
Looking for the right girl, why you all up on me?
Love me for a night, girl, hate me in the morning
Yeah I know your type girl, so I make her blow me
Lil Peep

Look me in my eyes, girl
Tell me if you think that it's a lie, girl
Getting tired of your girl
I know I need my own girl, my girl
[x2]

Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first


[Lil Peep:]
I just wanna see you smile, I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true
I'll be on my own, no crew
Out here making these moves
Singing these big city blues
I don't wanna think about you
Every time I think about you
I swear I fall in love again
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Coldhart

[Coldhart:]
And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beating heavy for me
And I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you got stars for eyes
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sitting drinking whiskey, hoping that you miss me
Baby say you do (please say you do)
Maybe say you do


Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
[x2]

Love now, cry later, cry later
But I always take the chance
But I always take the chance
If I could save her
If I could save her
She said she got other plans, damn

Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts

I know you got a man
Give me your hand (fuck it)
Teen romance
Give me this dance
Yeah, I took a xan (yeah)
I hope you understand
(She don't)
Let me guide you to a place where
No one hurts you, you are safe here with me
(With me, with me)


Let me down just like my drug
Call my plug

Looking at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud
[x2]

And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't getting nothing but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me

I be in The Bay, I be in LA
I be on stage, bitches kissing on my face
What I'm tryin to say
Let's take it by the day
I'm the one you want, not the one you trying to save
I got a broken heart, you were like a blade
Tearing me apart, but I kinda like the pain
She like it when it rain
She like that I'm insane
I like it that she gay
She like me for my brain
Lil Bo Peep

Looking at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud

And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't getting nothing but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me

Girl, you don't know my name
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name

[Lil Tracy:]
True Religion jeans, pockets full of cocaine
Tattoos on my face, I'mma die this way
I don't wanna talk, so I flex and I finesse
Only inhale the best, exhale the stress
Used to be broke, I cast a spell on my check
Ice on my neck, now my ex sends me texts
Ask me if I still love her, I'm on xans, I forget
Bitch, did you forget? You cut through me like a wrist
I'm finna get rich, snortin' coke in a Benz
You don't know my name, you don't know my pain
On the highway to hell in a Beamer, switchin' lanes
Six hundred sixty six kisses on your face
Baby, now that I'm gone, do you hallucinate?
And see me in your room with that Gucci on my waist?
I'm so far away, now I'm in L.A
Gothic bitch, skinny waist, pussy drippin' like cocaine

[Lil Peep:]
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl you don't know my name
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl you don't know my name

[Slug Christ:]
She talkin' got me soddin' in shame, girl, you drive me insane
Only you can occupy any space in my heart and in my brain
I fade away in saturated gray
It's just one way to numb it all away
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain killer
Snort it all away for a second, I'll feel better
Fake ass bitches plottin' on a Young Slugger
Diamorphine and I'm self medicatin', yeah
See different, you said you felt the same
Girl, I thought you knew my pain


[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby, watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall
I'll cop it all, castle halls

[Lil Tracy:]
Baby, I'm an asshole, walkin' thru my castle
I can break your heart, baby, I know it's so fragile
Step inside my castle, we blowin' on that good dope
Put this in your nostril, baby, I got good blow
Fuck her, then I vanish, disappear like magic
I live lavish, Gucci sheets all on my mattress
Goth Boy Clique, skrrt skrrt in a black whip
Pullin' down her skirt, I know you want it, you can't have it
Welcome to my castle, it's just me and you tonight
I think you're an angel, just a human in disguise
This is not rap, it's a goth lullaby
I'll be in your dreams every time that we get high
Lie, lie, lie, all you ever do is lie
Look me in my eyes like the stars in the sky
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die

[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall
I'll cop it all, castle halls

Took her to the crib and I show her how I die
Every night, then I wake up and I'm still fuckin' high
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby pour another cup
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby pour another cup

[Lil Tracy:]
I just dropped a pill in my champagne
She said she love me she don't even know my real name
Hoppin' out the Uber on a Friday
Gothic bitch, her Gucci bag got bags of cocaine
I've been living life my way
I can't fuck with you if we weren't friends on Myspace
Lord why, Lord why do I wanna die?
I'mma get a Maserati just to take my life inside
Baby sip this wine, tell me are you down to ride
Cause when I get a castle I won't let no one inside
I'm so magical my wrist glisten in your dreams
Skinny nigga up next countin' guap with LiL PEEP, yah

[Lil Peep:]

Till this pretty young white bitch hopped up in my ride

So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory
Can this be him, this hellboy?

Show after show, fucking hoe after hoe

Pull up in a park and these bitches look at me (look at Peep)
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now


[Lil Peep:]
All this stress
Look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead
Dyin' out west
Tryin' my best
Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane
I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight

[Lil Tracy:]
Look in the mirror
I see a demon, I'm barely breathing
My shadow is bleeding
On the highway, baby, I'm speeding
I'm leavin' the city, you should be with me
Two weeks with the same old jeans on
I know you want to die, baby, this is your theme song
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on

[Lil Peep:]
All this stress

Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique make a hoe shake
Black fur, black coat
Gothboiclique in the back hoe
Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique till my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
Gothboiclique in the castle

[Lil Tracy:]
In high school I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on

[Lil Peep:]
When I die bury me with all my ice on
When I die bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
When I die bury me with all my ice on
When I die bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Lil Tracy:]
Clothes off baby I got good white
Tell me a secret, and I'll tell one of mines
I just wanna talk, I don't wanna fight
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?

[Lil Peep:]
Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you
Left the drugs behind for you
I can't help you make it through, that's what I do
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go

[Lil Tracy:]
Here we go again, wakin' up again
I know a lot of shit, but I don't know what day it is
I really like you, but I'ma die fast
So you should run away, and don't look back
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up baby I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood
I was wide awake, you were havin' a nightmare
You said you think that you're in Hell, I'll catch a flight there
I'll be right there, for you
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up, baby, I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood

Hate it when you fight me, love it when I die slow
She just wanna bite me, I could see your eyes glow
Kill me in my white tee, baby, let my blood flow
Let my blood flow, let my blood flow

You're the one hoe, lookin' for my love though
Where my love go, baby, where my gun go?

Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
Goth Boi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

Popping pills, thinking about you

I was used to you
"What have you been through?"
She asked me
Every fucking kind of abuse

If you love me too,
You would give me you
Lock me in your room,
Don't tell me the truth

Everything you said,
Stayed inside my head
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I try to go, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind, I been on my own since age nine

16 lines of blow and I'm fine

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?

B-B-Bis Los on the track, boy

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You-you could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (For sure)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (and you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could I could-I could, uh, uh

I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool (like a fool)
Eatin' lemon pepper, with a lepper playin' pool
Damn, my man a Cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I can not get enough
So I'm strictly smokin' wax , 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gain, I need me a sad bitch
My life, ain't lavish, I ain't ever had a shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you had it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my thrown laughin'
Lil Peep spazzin', skeetin' on your mattress
Creepin' through the night time, blood on my classics

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)

You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (For sure)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (and you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could-I could, I could-I could

She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
'Cause the blood don't show, hoe
I can not, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can't do, 'fore the puffin'
Gon' have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money you would be lickin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is distinctive
What's that money for the takin' 'cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then, spend your life in the pen'
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man?

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (Let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

Pepper
Twice the effort, under pressure
Twice the effort, under pressure

You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window

But it's so dark and I was under club lights

Call me on my iphone
I don't pick it up much
I've been losing friends, I don't feel right

4 Gold Chains, gave 2 to my brothers
Fame bring pain, but the pain make money

Girls numb the pain and the drugs get me numb-er

I had a plan to kill
Myself and you for real
With my gun, I'll take your life
I'm no fun without my knife

If I I want to I will cut you, I will make you feel my pain
If I need to I will bleed you, I will make you go insane
When the time comes I will sacrifice my love in the moonlight
Whenever I cum I feel half as nice as I did when it's you, right


Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Running out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die, would you even cry?
If I end my life, would you hold me tight then?

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal (Døves):]
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
(And I'm so lost), under club lights
(In the all black), GothBoiClique

[Lil Peep:]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal (Døves):]
(Fucked up in the back of the club)
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
(I got scars on me, no love)
Light a candle and I pray for doves
(And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue)
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
(I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood)
(It's so fucked)
So tell me what is love
(If I ever had it), if I ever had it
(Did I really want it?)
(And why can't I remember?)
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
(It's a slow drug)
And I swear that
(But it's true love)
These are true lines

[Døves:]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

[Lil Peep:]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid

I know you love xans, but there is no way you forgot about the way that I held your hand
Should we try again, give it another chance
I don't think it's worth it, I don't think it's worth it
Pouring red wine in a chalice
I sip slow, can't spill it on my fabric
You're like a switchblade, cut right through me
I kinda like it though, baby, cut through me
Vampire in the club in the back now
Heartthrob girls have me as their background
I don't care though, I want you to care though
I cast a love spell, baby, you'll be back though

All I ever wanted was a Benz and a bad bitch

Make a few racks, call the plug back
She like baby, where you goin'? When you comin' back?

Main bitch wilding, pussy in my diet

Everything you said to me was at the perfect time
Baby girl, you know it's not right, not right, it's not right

She crying diamonds

Bitch I'm shining

It's alright to tell me
What you think about me
I won't try to argue
Or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving
You must have your reasons
The season is calling
Your pictures are falling down

The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing and structure
Did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone, I won't come back

And it'll happened once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up


[Lil Peep:]
I don't give a fuck how you feeling about me
Back of the club, bad bitches around me
Back in the day why everyone doubt me
Look at my outfit, somebody count me
Choke on my dick if you're trying to shade me
I don't give a fuck if you're trying to play me
I don't give a fuck if you're trying to save me
Yeah I got bitches not one of them date me

[Eddy Baker:]
Know I pulled up with a box of blunts
Range Rover filled with sluts
Shoe box filled with blunts
Rolling up that stinky skunk
Light it up, they know what's up
Getting money with my bros
Bad bitches they show us love
Hit the crib and let us fuck
Came in sober leaving drunk
Young nigga I'm having fun
Lean in my hawwiian punch
Drank too much I'm throwing up
All my shows be going up
That's why your girl be choosing us
[?]
My life like Ferris Bueller [?]
Posted in the breakfast club
Just like [?] smoking drugs
Where's my molly we're gon try and see if she fuck with a thug
Healthyboyz cartel
Got narcotics if you need a buzz
Blowing all my money on designer cause I'm young and dumb


Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ride around downtown with me
Everyone wanna ride around town with Peep

I be in the backseat smoking on thraxx
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B, Free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back

Everyone wanna ride around town with me
Making money ride around downtown with me
Everyone wanna ride around town with Peep

I be in the backseat smoking on thraxx
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B
Free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back


[Lil Peep:]
I'll be right here, when you step out the car
I see you from afar, but I know who you are
I know exactly who you are, what you're looking for
I know exactly where it starts, and I'm not looking forward to the end
Because we're not gonna last
Because we took it too fast, and that's a good way to crash and burn
What I learned, I don't like taking my turn
If she mine, she gon' be mine until we ash in an urn
Let me burn, let me swerve, let me pull up on the curb
Now I'm looking so absurd, But I'm all that they heard, at the party pull-up rari
Up in the haze on the scene up in the haze on the scene
Light a hundred fuckin' dutchs and then I follow my dreams
Girl you're fuckin with Lil Peep, I'm the king of the teens
I just dropped a couple singles and take over the scene
Got the internet buzzing, 20 thousand a week
Now I practice getting pussy, I practice all that I preach
Peep

[Gizmo:]
I'll be right there when you need me close
I'll always be around when you need me the most
But I know, that you've been trying to get away from me
But you just don't know what to say to me
I just gotta do what I think I'm meant to
Everything I said is true in that text I sent you
So if you ain't gon' be my boo, then just do you
I'm smoking blunts, like they cigarettes
I still ain't shit, I ain't gotten any bigger yet
But that factor ain't something that really matters to me
Ain't nothing to think about when I'm chilling, smoking my weed
I burn it down, and then proceed to seek out all my hopes and dreams
The future holds itself so it ain't really what it seems
If I can't get to where I want, I'll be pissed
I'll tie my neck up in a noose, kick the chair and slit my wrists

She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head
Playing with your hair, laying in my bed

I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me

Baby, it's no fair, girl, I'm a mess

I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me

Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?
Now I'm your everything and I've got you on your knees
I got this little problem - I might make you bleed
"So what's the problem?" - she said
"Baby, make me scream!"

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams

And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
(I'll be waiting for you)


[Lil Peep:]
Now I'm one step closer to hell
I can feel the ghostway comin' on
Thirty bitches wanna fuck me though
Same bitches that was hatin' on my first song
Now they say they want to fuck me with my jays on
Drugs gone, probably 'cause, me and pain, took 'em off
Nobody told you I got tears on my shirt
Blame me self if you ever get hurt, somebody kill
Drugged out, plug house, try to cop another fix
Fans all up on my dick, but they don't know my government
There till I'm fuckin' rich
Lil peep, lil pain, tell 'em hoes, suck a dick
Brokeboy sad as shit, I don't really give a shit
Sellin' reggie by a brick
[?] they couldn't make me trip
They mad, they couldn't make me flip
Hit a bitch, hit a dip, nineties baby, gettin' lit
Bang, Bang, hit a lick, liquid got me ignorant

[Lil Pain:]
I'm Reggie Bush, Reggie Miller, Reggie Jackson
In my hood they call me reggie
Cause' the reggie's what I'm packin'
Sippin', trippin', trickin', smokin', thinkin', shit that you can [?]
All these tits keep overflowin', told lil peep to pass a [?]
I'm lookin' in the mirror, [?] just a stranger
I see pain, I see sorrow, I see her, I see angle
Put the [?] to my head
And this [?] in the chamber
Now my eyes are bloody red
That means all I see is danger
There's bitch inside my bed
She ain't muscle, I won't blame her
She keep cryin', I keep lyin' but the true is I won't save her
So now she hates me but that's fine, because I hate my self
The truth is I'm tryin' to save my self
Peep waddup


Spoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast
The words "I love you" meant so much, now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and think about our first kiss by the tree and how it meant so much to

Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But, all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But I think of you on the road
You know, I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said "I hate you" 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

Ya got one more chance at a night like this (Yeah, yeah)

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

And that's real shit (real), we keep it real, bitch (real)
I'm a goth boy, kinda like my whole clique
You a bad one (true), we should have fun
Let's fuck in the all-black Benz truck (skrrr, skrr)
Six racks on (Peep), six packs gone (sheesh)
I'm a bad boy, we ain't gonna last long (nah)
I could make you (damn), I could break you (yeah)
Baby, think of all the places I can take you

What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'mma die young, I'ma get killed
What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'mma die young, baby, I'ma get killed, aye

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

[Lil Tracy:]
I can see the future I see paparazzi
Bad bitch riding on me rolling off the molly
That's your girl? Wait, hold up she ain't let me know it
Instagram, she posting photos just hoping I notice
Step in the club, they tryna get cameras in focus
I'm a vampire, I do not like the light on me
Fuck a friend, fuck a homie
I'm all by my lonely
Kush smoking, wine pouring at four in the morning
Peep and Tracy, two Mercedes, we race to the castle
No new friends, I feel like Drake baby I'm such a asshole
Break the cocaine off the brick and put it in her asshole
Vampire in the moonlight counting up the pesos

[Lil Peep:]
Blowing kisses in the wind
I'ma show her how I swim when the lights get dim

We just met on meeting ends

[Horse Head:]
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all

[Lil Peep:]
You got my number yet? Six hundred sixty-six
Diamond rings, I'm a devil with some angel wings
I know a lot of shit, I don't ever talk shit
Lil Peep, big dick, ask my ex bitch
I've been through a lot of shit, it got me flexing
I've been through a lot of shit, so it got me sexting
Got sucked up twice in the same night
Call my baby on the west, catch a late flight
She just hang tight, I know a lot of girls like you
But my world falls down when I fight you
Beside you, can I remind you?
I wanna die too, I wanna die too

[Horse Head:]

[Lil Tracy:]
Clinically depressed gang, GothBoiClique
Wine in my chalice, take a hundred sips
Hundred girls on my dick, but I just want you
Vampire bite your neck, blood on my lip
French kiss, baby now you're one of us
Now you speak my language, they can't understand us
I'm hot, coming up like the sunrise
But I feel most alive, in the moonlight

Waitin' for my death, while I count some tens
Shawty layin' on my chest in the back of the Benz
I can see you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
I don't even know you, but you act like we're friends?
She ain’t gonna meet another one like me
Puts you to the ground while you kept walkin'
Yeah, it say "Gucci" on my plain white tee
That's a grown man flex, stop playin' with me

I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch


We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same
If you couldn't tell

I'm bout' to give her everything she ever wanted and more
What I deliver, it's something that can't be bought at the store
I'm tryna bring you with me, baby, while I'm finding myself
That feeling when you kiss me tells me I don't need no one else
I had to lose my mind a couple times to find out it's you
I had to run around the world, girl, just to be here, it's true
These other women don't got nothing on the way that she moves
Let's pick up right where we left off last night, inside of my room

When the time come
I'll be right here
Sippin' liquor with a grin on my face, for you
I got nothing left to keep me awake
I don't got no better thing to do than sit here and wait
For you
For you
For you
For you

I can get through this (For you)

So I drown my pain in sex

I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red night lights
Walls close in like last night
I'm all in like last night
I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red night lights
Walls close in like last night
I'm all in like last night
Whether in the morning doesn't matter to you
Something strange gonna happening to you
Whether in the morning doesn't matter to you
Something strange gonna happening to you

Pouring up the Act when I'm in Houston like I'm Maxo

And I'm smoking cookies, smoking cookie girl scout
And I'm stepping on the gas stove
I just downed a Xanny and I hope that I don't crash though
Niggas hating on me and I know that it's the cash flow
Please don't call my phone if you ain't talking 'bout the cash, hoe
I don't do no dirt 'cause I got shooters, I got racks, hoe
And my bitch so cold that she gon' blow me like a saxo

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

That we used to do, I was used to you
What have you been through? she asked me
Every fuckin kind of abuse
If you loved me too, you would give me you
Lock me in your room, don't tell me the truth
Everything you said (everything you said)
Stayed inside my head (stayed inside my head)
All the shit you said, all the blood I bled

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs


Loving you is like a fairytale
I just can't pick up the phone again
This time I'll be on my own, my friend
One more time, I'm all alone again

Sex with you is like I'm dreaming, and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now you're gone, I can't believe that
Time I spent with you deceiving me
I don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leaving me
I don't care if you believe me
I still wonder why you tease me

And if I'm taking this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)
I hope you know I'm faded, all of this liquor I'm drinking
And if I'm taking this the wrong way (wrong way)
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)

When the moon hit your skin, I could see you and him
Not you and me, yeah, but it's just you and me, yeah
When the sun shines above, you wake up with the one you love
Not you and me, yeah, but it's just you and me, yeah
(All alone again)

Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it

Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face, when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings

None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea

Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason


[Lil Peep:]

So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feeling lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beating so loud
Why you running away, I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down

I remember the first time
Baby, this is the last time
You were nothin' more to me
Than when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
There is nothin' more to me than you
I died that day you left my room in tears

This is the last time
Me and you are a past time
And I know that you and I both wish this didn't have to end like this
But, it's that time
Put the kid on the map time
I just finished the last line
Can't believe it's the last night, the last fight with you

I remember the first time
Baby, this is the last time
You were nothin' more to me
Then when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you

To get high as the moon

Broken heart - Can't breath in the waiting room

Many men have tried to save you but all they do is try
Woke up on a lonely day, she can't help but wonder why
I saw it on her face, she wanna make those fuckers cry
She ends up in a better place inside when she get high

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
Stick that needle in my eye

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Pour that drip up in my faygo
In my city y'all gotta say so
I was just talking to Fredo
Then I woke up he was gone
All my friends are really dead
Still hear their voices in my head
These days it's hard to sleep alone
I beg my baby, please don't go
Please don't go
I can handle my rivals but can't fight these demons alone
Please don't go
All these fakes, all these snakes in the grass gotta keep it cut low
Keep the circle small, stand tall through it all
Praying I don't fall, no they'd rather see me long gone

[Lil Peep:]
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
