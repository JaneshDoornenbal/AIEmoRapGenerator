[SZA:]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me
To think I had it..
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breathe, breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming
Just do it
Yeah yeah yeah, I hear you talking
Yeah yeah yeah, feel you moving
Lets do it, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

[SZA & XXXTENTACION:]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self infliction
Blood stains in my gold plates, without a soul, impure hate
Insecure ay, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine (Ah! Ah!)
History, mystery, hate her, fuck him
What's meant to me?
Was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt (Fuck!)
Ice Hotel

[XXXTENTACION:]
Ice, ice, ice
Feel the love in the air,
Hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, legislate for eight
Seven virgins
Swerve and converge
Her rapes lurking, curtain
Covered sins soon rest unwritten
Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel

And I, could've been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And I, could've been
Dead, boy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
Just face the abyss, and I (aye!)
Place blame for this shit
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that's the gist
First, you can see it on me, I'm pissed
Lost in the mist, pants full of piss
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies

Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...

[xxxtentacion:]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
WiFi's off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

Wake up to your face
I'm straight forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I held the ground you walk on
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay


Star fall, fear calls waiting on you I'd never run
Kiss, fuck, I won't feel I doubt that I would ever want
Hold me, kiss me, fuck me, you don't wanna love
Haunt me, hang me, love me I don't ever love

There's an Elephant In this Room
There's an Elephant In this Room

There she was with the blade in her hand
Scars on her skin replace kiss of the man
She's played a part for as long as she's known
Regret fills her heart as her love leaves her home
She's learnt to be passive but such is a loss
Accepting defeat when I foreclose the cause
For her, this was needed to be rid of the pain
You play the victim, I'll play it sane

Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists till my heartbeat is silent
Shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

Stomp out that fucker his death will be slow
You made me do this just as far as you know
If you don't exist then my pain can be rid
So I gut the fucker then eat like a pig

Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists till my heartbeat is silent
Shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists till my heartbeat is silent
Shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

I am the heart marksman

Where you said you were going
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can [x4]

I don't remember much
I just seen her dead in there
It definitely stood out
I remember your smell when I touched you
How you used to talk to me
It all hurts so much now
How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even love me
Even though all the time I spent, its just worthless
Now I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore
Save me

Indeed I am ready, my outfit in vain

King of the dead, I sever your head
When shit touch the river, my reign will be fed
I touch the sky and bring life to the dead

Found this out in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore the song, the more-
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music
It's nice, actually

I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies that I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth, I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth, pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death, I don't need no fucking help

[Marilyn Manson, Bill O'Reilly & XXXTENTACION:]
You can take some of your lyrics as you know, you'll understand when I'm dead. I mean, these disturbed kids can take these lyrics and say, "You know when I'm dead, everybody's going to know me."
Well, I think that's a very valid point, and I think that that's a reflection of a -not necessarily this program, but of television in general. If you die and enough people are watching, then you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well-known. So when you have things like Columbine and you have these kids that are angry and they have something to say and no one's listening, the media sends a message that if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention, then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of Time Magazine, the media gave them exactly what they wanted

I am a dog, girl abort
Shoot pregnant wife in a Porsche
That is expensive abortion
I ran it up, fuck a portion
Ain't had no family like orphans
Might sell some xans to the orphanage
On your face might stomp the yard
On my mom I'd catch a charge
Play with pussy like guitar
I'm the realest one thus far
You are just running, a candidate
Your girlfriend said you are minute man
Bitch, my traphouse, it got management

I got no heart I'm a manikin

Now since a jit I been in love with that fuck shit
40 clips causing white noise in her voice that she sniff no distortions
Half a fat check on my teeth like I'm Norbit
OG gas pack to contaminate lungs
Now I'm higher than orbits
Falling off like [?], put the force into her core
I'm the one like I'm Obi, forcing whores to forfeit
Come within my circle, we gone clip your vocals

[xxxtentacion:]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin [x3]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin
I got no heart, I'm a manikin


I see Black skies, and white lies I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me
Fueling my insecurities (as the ground right under me)
Crumbles if it wasn't there
It's too much
My hearts crushed
I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness because it's all lies
I've seen the pain
I run away so many times
Death and I are companions
He's here at all times
I won't love
Won't trust
I won't die
I can't feel but managed to steal your heart, love
It's dirt poor and I fuck whores who want love
It seems that anything offered can be enough but
It's time
Body falls so I don't know who to call at all
And my heart can't take on my broken soul
... I'm so fucking numb
My life has succumb to hate, Trinidad
Alone, in the snow


Stop, I don't usually be on this trap shit but
shout out my nigga Vinny Changos, rest in peace Roach

I'm in the trap spot, I need the high spot
I heard the door knock, it's time to sell the rock
Jit with the bleed, leave blood in my lean
The bitch a molly fiend, she like to fucking tweak
I hit it really far, like "where it go though"
He fucked a fan, a middle man and now she don't like me vro
the "we don't fight shit" how awful, damn bitch
I keep the tool cause I'm so vool, my nigga real real

We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

Lost in the pessimistic state of perception
It's been hard to participate in natural instances
And due to my history, I don't know what's next for me
But keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said
I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth

Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift to a place, where the devil lives
My soul rise to the sky, made of abyss
With the evidence, that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now
We tearing it down, we make these incredible sounds
We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

From everything you made
You try to erase
Memories will fade

[XXXTENTACION:]
I'm doing drugs so I can maintain
Part of the reason that I can handle this damn pain
"I'm fuckin' numb" said the lonely heart of the drummer boy
Who'd rather wreak havoc than play around with a Tonka toy
Uh, shit, my mirror ain't been clearer lately
I see my mind becoming blind, material mistaken
Heart indulging in the things that are forever broken
I seen a father lose his son, why life so fucking hopeless?
Uh, ayy, concept of my depression is
That there's no fucking recollection when your birth begins
And there's nobody there to hold you when the pain begins
But there's somebody there to fold you when you're caving in
Uh, yuh, such discussed by such and such
You're a fucking loser man, well life's a fucking uppercut
Right inside my fucking gut
Wanna fuckin' end it but
I don't have the balls to
Fuck, I'm such a pussy, fuck me up

Numbness and hell, what we crave right now
No, I can't feel no pain right now


[Kin$oul:]
Everlasting pain, blast my brain
Smokin' on dank, to hide my pain
I ain't gon' lie, shit won't change
Fuck the system, I ain't playing no games
Words like ammunition, click, clack position
One shot to your head, information was given
Nigga, shut up and listen
I'ma show you a vision
And take your mind on a mission and understand why you livin'
These niggas ass rappers, full-time actors
I can kill a track, even if I rap backwards
Fuck a studio, all a nigga need is a Macbook
And a little bit of drugs and a Backwood
And I'ma start spitting my pain
All of this shit in my brain
I don't think nothing's gon' change
But there's motherfuckin' money in the bank
Ooh, yeah, got my minds on some other shit
High as a mothership
Surprise, how I'm stuntin' bitch
Polite, with the pussy, I say "hi" when I'm comin' in
Talk all this shit, but the truth, you ain't got it bitch
Shawty hit me up, told her I will be there right away
Hide your partner pussy, pop a xanax, sleep my night away
Wake up, feelin' like this won't be the finest days
But it gets more better, smokin' the finest haze

Everybody stressin', lookin' for a blessing
Might just use a weapon, just to send a message
Everybody stressin', lookin' for a blessing
Might just use a weapon, just to send a message

[XXXTENTACION:]
And it always seem like all the fucking voices in my head
Is tryna see me dead, before I see my mother wed
And I remember way back when, when I was dead
Broke, I was a fucking joke
Nobody wanted to fuck with me
Remember sleeping on my nigga Will bed
Doing anything just to make sure his nigga fed
And now I'm recollecting all the fucking tears I shed
Just to get to where I am
And everybody wanna fuck with me
Remember bed bugs, bed sheets that felt like old rugs
And now we finally made it out the damn slums
Remember bitches actin' like old nuns
Now they pop they pussy like porn stars if a nigga want some
And that's a damn shame
I'm not ashamed, if you press my nigga Kin
Bullets rippin' through your damn brain
And that's for anybody fucking with my clique
I feel like Yeezy, 'cause ain't nobody fucking with my clique
Jah!

And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga
And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga

17
My collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real life situations I've lived
17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
My own personal number
Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
By listening to this album, you are literally
And I cannot stress this enough
Literally
Entering my mind
And if you are not willing to accept my emotion
And hear my words fully
Do not listen
I do not value your money
I value your acceptance and loyalty
Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
I put my all into this
In the hopes that it will help cure
Or at least numb your depression
I love you
Thank you for listening
Enjoy

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

Trapped in a concept
Falsely accused
Misused, and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you fucking rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fucking comforting
And I can't seem to shake this fucking feeling in my...

The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck and the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
This is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
At all


Ooh ahh ahh
She showed me the things love can't forget
Oh it hurt now
Made a list of my regrets
And you were the first, love
Oh it hurts, I can't forget
How it hurt now, oh
Made a list of my regrets


Yeah
Oh my God, Ronny

It's a vibe, yeah, feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet, got a nigga throwed (Yuh, yuh)

[Donald Trump:]
But a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration
And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville
So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thank...

[XXXTENTACION:]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacing men
Will fucking swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart is gone in series of corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacing men

[XXXTENTACION (Donald Trump):]
Why the fuck should I apologize?
Countries orderless, it's a lie
By these fucking government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future
It's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
Where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind, the flies within our walls
I'm feeling like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, depending on people resembling Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it’s PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Donald Trump:]
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives
No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society
And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play

To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less but to say more, was ideal for this project, and till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show th- to open minds in a self was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again me entering your mind. feeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy. Enjoy.


I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth

Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of hardest ever
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas
And bomb whatever
Say we don't move calmly never, this for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort, no pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxing these niggas extra

[Donald Trump:]
But a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration
And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville
So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thank...

[XXXTENTACION:]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends

Why the fuck should I apologize?
Countries orderless, it's a lie
By these fucking government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future
It's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
Where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind, the flies within our walls
I'm feeling like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, depending on people resembling Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it’s PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Donald Trump:]
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives
No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society
And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play

This brings the vibe of 17 straight into this new album and it's enough for people to be like okay, okay
Exactly exactly, so you don't have to give them 6, 7 songs that were the old vibe Yeah
Like if there was one that was the updated version of 17, yeah (Exactly)
Should this be number 1 on the album? (I don't know)
I feel like it's fire
I just, it might just be a hit to be honest, it might be a hit and like my mind
'Cause you're part of my energy now, so it's like when you hear a song from me it's almost like you're hearing the song from yourself so it's like you know my capabilities

Or it might, it might, so start- yeah yeah right, the perfect mix, the perfect mix (I hear what you're saying, it's gonna be like, yeah it gotta be like)
You should like a drop where it like, you should make a drop where it likes, "So in love"

[John Cunningham:] I'm recording this
[XXXTENTACION:] Yeah
[John Cunningham:] Just so I have it for reference
[XXXTENTACION:] Okay
[John Cunningham:]
What do you want? You know what I mean? This is your video, like you can create whatever you want
[XXXTENTACION:]
Like remember how I told you, like zoom into my eyes, then have it zoom out of the eyes and then we'll be in a different scene, we can really play on that and do like a lot of things
[John Cunningham:]
Well that it makes it way easier in terms of transitioning and terms of scenes
[XXXTENTACION:]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, all the-, each scene would zoom out of my eye and zoom into my eye, like I wanna be in the-, like this is gonna be green screen, right? We're gonna have to like, have like a chair, like a chair or a couch, right? And I want everything around me to be blacked out, like remember how in that one scene where I was like-, I was like-, I was like in the, um-, in like this blue place and shit, this time I want it to be all darkness
[John Cunningham:]
Like a massive, big black room where there's-, you don't know where the end is?
[XXXTENTACION:]
A-, a massive, big black room and you you don't know where-, where it is, and I'm like sitting-, and I'm sitting and there's a masked man in front of me, right? And they don't show his face, but you can see-
[John Cunningham:]
You said a massive man?
[XXXTENTACION:]
Sorry, I'm sorry, not a masked man, a hooded man and you can-, you don't see his face, it just shows the hood and he has on like, a cloak, and he speaks to me and he says "They do not understand you. Do you not fear? The worst enemy is yourself and yet you seem unbothered. Although you cannot pretend like you have walked through life unscathed." And I'm gonna have him like-, I'm gonna come up with like, his dialog and come up with something crazy for him to say, and then it'll be like me within my own mind, little do they realize like, this is all like, my world, right? So it's like, I'm gonna come up with like, this whole concept of like amounting to the light that I can become, and like understand-, like, bro, the con-, the concept can be like genius
So-
And then we can jump-, then we can like jump into the scene where I could say-, where as like-, 'cause then obviously it's like "Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go" and then like-, you can tie those line-, you can tie those lyrics on to like, someone that's a let-, afraid to let go of my previous self in fear that the fact of who I will truly become
[John Cunningham:] Letting go of someone else, you said?
[XXXTENTACION:]
Letting go of my previous self, you get what I mean?
[John Cunningham:] Yeah
[XXXTENTACION:]
Because that my-, my previous self holds like, my memories hold me to the person that I was, you understand?
[John Cunningham:] Yeah
[XXXTENTACION:]
So in the same aspect, like "Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go", you see how you can tie those line-, that tie-, that tie to that concept, what do you feel that's it's missing? Because if-, if it's missing anything 'cause obviously tomorrow is Friday and Saturday is very soon, um, oh-ho, Rufus is so fucking cute, bruh
[John Cunningham:] Literally a little leopard
[XXXTENTACION:]
However, I do feel that there is things missing and I'm gonna have to come up with something for that and then prob'
[John Cunningham:] So what you wanna do? Go to bed right now?
[XXXTENTACION:]
No, I'm not going to bed, I'd would like to go sit in front of my computer so I can remember exactly what I'm doing
[John Cunningham:]
Do you wanna go write it down or something?
Yes
Then go, go do it, are we done, should I-, should I dip?
[XXXTENTACION:]
Yes, yes-, no, you don't have to dip, I mean-
I mean if you wanna dip, yeah, then you probably
[John Cunningham:]
I mean, what, what else, do you think you gonna come up with anything else that's worth me staying around for?
[XXXTENTACION:] Shit, I mean, not-nothing that I can't send to you
[John Cunningham:] Alright


Hello, you've come here in search of release, huh? Feeling the need to inspire your soul? Wanting to disappear to a place you could feel outside of your skin? Well, you've found one: a place within my mind.

Oh, oh, don't break my heart
Bmun os m'I, emas eht leef t'nod I dna
Yeah
No dloh ot tsuj niap 'nileef eb ll'I, niap 'nileef eb ll'I

Listen close, what is this?
Is it heart break?
Is it truly what it feels like?
What it sound like?
What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feeling like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowing through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry

I guess I'm at a loss for words
To feel so close to someone, and for them to be gone the next day
I guess you never realize how permanently damaging that is


I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me
I, I was lost

So I took a different path, in the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessing his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessing he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost

I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me
I, I was lost

And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming
He told me "kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, "how far are you from home?"
I said, "maybe 30 minutes"
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image
I should've run right fucking there, I-

You ever woke up on a train track
With no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Trying to scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody coming, so you scream on
And scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you?
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time is finally up


I was like oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Won't look back on my mind
Won't let bad out my shine
Won't let you cloud my mind
Won't let you cloud my mind
All my days, I was crying
All my lows, all my highs
Told my Mom, "I'm gon' shine"
Told my love, "I'm gon'-"

And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh


Yeah

Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now

I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah, oh
Realize she just want me hit it right
'Cause I get 'em goin' right

Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now


Ahem
Yeah

I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
Screaming words with no remorse
Pitchforks pointed at my heart
I was staring at the sky

We're gonna break!
We're gonna break!
We're gonna break!
We're gonna break!

I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky


[Kanye West:]
So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down, stoney, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don’t negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in 'Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwing rocks at your grave
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out at a rave
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it
All the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man
So I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin'
No more lames is hangin'
No more fame in famous
Ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman’s terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

Members Only. Mad it’s been a whole four months without you. I’ve been in the worst pain in my life. It's been so crazy, some-, sometimes I forget how to eat, or sleep, how to even function right. I miss, it's so weird not calling you everyday, making sure you’re okay. Sometimes we’d talk for hours, sometimes we’d talk for minutes, talk about all types of things. Sometimes we’d joke around, sometimes talk about deep conversations. To being at your house every weekend for six months straight playing League with Illie, Rico, and Leo, to being on ice and will, to riding out on, on the road, and just talking about life and have so many ideas just bouncin' back to each other. Listening to the new, listening to the albums, to the music. You taught me so much these last few years. You taught me how to be a man, how to assert control. Taught me how, how to deal with certain things didn't need to be dealt with, how to block out the negativity, all that energy I didn't need. I could go on and on for all, for all the memories we had, but damn. Think I've shared so much, it's like every time we got off the phone, the last time, the last time we talked, the last thing you said was, "I love you." I love you, Jah. Thank you for everything.

Baby, you're the one
Baby, you're the one for me


[Killstation:]
The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand

There's still a part of me
I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be
The only one alone inside your head
There's still a part of me
I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be
The only one alone

The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand
The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand

[XXXTENTACION:]
Drowin' in all of my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend
Drowin' in all of my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend

[Killstation:]
Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend
Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend

The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand


Hey

Spend time waitin' for you
You know I adore for you
Realized, long before you
You know I tried with you, know it
Real love, know I saw you
Said you can't hide beneath your
Pain, I seen it with my eyes

Duh, duh-duh, duh, duh

Pain, I seen it with my eyes


[Noah Cyrus:]
I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
It's going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

[XXXTENTACION & (Noah Cyrus):]
(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my myself
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

[XXXTENTACION (Noah Cyrus):]
(Oh)
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
(Oh)
But I need you, and I love you more
Every minute
(Oh)
In January, and December, I want you
(Oh)
You're my ecstasy

[Noah Cyrus & (XXXTENTACION):]
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Oh)
Sifting up a reason from the lonely dirt (Woah, woah, woah)
When it's over, you'll be golden (Woah, woah, woah)
Over, over (Over, over, over)
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Woah, woah, woah)
Sucking up the dust from your static crown (Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God)
Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)
Over, over (Woah, What? What?)

[Noah Cyrus:]
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time? (Right, right, right, oh)

[XXXTENTACION:]
To the drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'm a common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly (Oh)
It's a tricky course, never that way
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and the ninety clips

Lacy, Lacy, Lacy
One more request
Release my pain (Ha)

[Noah Cyrus:]
Did you think you got all that you came for?
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone

[XXXTENTACION:]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just a man who murdered many in sake of himself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf

[Joey Bada$$:]
Slow dancing with the devil and in a burnin' room
Two steppin' ahead, until they lock me in a tomb
Been doomed since they pulled us out the womb
Satan preyin' on me, she be throwin' souls inside the wombs
Life shoulda eat you up, spit you out, beat you up
But bitch, the door don't stay enough, don't think I see enough
Baby, I see too much, baby, I can't call it
I need my soul in these bars like a alcoholic
I can't trust nobody, I put that on mind, soul, and my whole body
I see demons and there's nothin' they don't know 'bout me
No matter I try to hide, they gon' find me
So now I never run from it, 'cause I come from it
I never lied, Devil's eyes in the beast's stomach
I look the Devil in the eyes, I could see she bluffin'
I pull the red dress to the side, tell her keep comin', keep comin'

[Kemba:]
I just found out family and enemies could be different
I was steppin' over syringes that's in my kitchen
After momma died, I couldn't go to the bathroom
Without gettin' some second-hand Hell with how I'm pissin'
This is just me paintin' a picture of what I live with
What you know about comin' home to your shit missin'?
And findin' out the niggas that helped you look for it had did it?
This is just me paintin' addiction
These niggas took methamphetamine, ketamine, edibles, and a bean
Niggas stole my denim jeans, them the thieves, DVDs, literally anything
Food I bought anything from the vending machine
Credit card crack any door, like janitor keys
Niggas even took credit for the man I would be
And if I let 'em he would probably take twenty percent, managing fee
I'm so scared of my genes, I considered celibacy
Afraid I would ruin my seeds, like Adam and Eve
I got blood on the fuckin' leaves of my family tree
Just give me one damn minute, this shit is hard for me
I lost my whole damn momma, I lost a part of me
She lost her whole damn life from systems of poverty
Grew up with Crown fried chicken cloggin' my arteries
Increase in robberies, police and bullets that I bob and weave
It was nonstop for me, no one was stoppin' me
Either fulfill myself or be a self-fulfilling' prophecy
This just how I introduce myself, talk to me
Kemba

All I had was Ramen noodles and a little iced tea
Now my life's like a movie, motherfuckin' Spike Lee
I just want canaries on my wristwatch, yeah
Niggas get buried in the slipknot, woah
Shorty think I'm married, but my dick's not, uh
I ain't get married 'til my dick drop, yeah
I just wanna hit it in some flip flops, woah
I don't want kids, I don't lip-lock, no
If you want love, better kick rocks, yeah
I'm a rock star, ho, Kid Rock, yeah

[XXXTENTACION:]
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh

Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh

What are you doing out in the middle of this field leaving your car?
I'm just not sure what he's thinking
He's getting back into his car, he's grabbed his bag
And from our vantage there's no one around him
You know, you wait for these things to end
But then you figure out it might wind up
He's completely alone
This is really starting to worry me, I gotta tell ya
I gotta tell ya

I been speakin' to the reaper, seein' spirits when I'm sleepin'
I been creepin' with them demons, shadows walkin' the flames
Sippin' blood with the leeches
Fuck the God, you will leave him
When I look in the mirror, all I see is disgrace
All of this rage, feelin' my face
There's mud at the end of my blade
Can't complain, everything okay
Scars on my heart, from feelin' this pain
I got a knife in my back, can't kill me though
Known to be dull, my feelin's froze
Pray to the sky, Lord, give me hope
Bitch, I'm born alone and die alone
Kept hoes in my halo, slave for the peso
Middle finger, fuck that
Land of the free, feed cans to the teens
Never trust police, bitch, I bust back
Fuck the government, never trust that
All the people wanna know where the love's at
We already know where the fuckin' drugs at
Where the guns at, get your scope, blatt

Yeah, hey, hey
I was in my house with some glass shards breaking out the backdoor (Yeah)
I'ma bash your track, oh, and I broke her backbone
Wild, heard her dad call
Pushed me on the damn floor, told me, "Put my pants on"
I was thinkin' a lot of things, by any means
I'll kill this bitch nigga if he try to take the fucking girl of my dreams
I'll kill first, put his ass in the dirt
Body bag 'cause he knows where trouble at
Earth, and he ran through first


It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain

Oh, oh

[Blink-182:]
Now I'm just a ghost in my own life
So make the most of this goodbye
Do you still dream about me late at night?
Or are you out there livin' better times?
You know it's killin' me to let go
I see your face but it's someone I don't know
Everything was perfect just an hour ago
Will you remember me tomorrow?

[XXXTENTACION:]
And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
And I won't let it control me

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
Oh, I won't let it control me

Okay, so it's recording, it's recording now.
It's 8: 31 AM and I am currently talking to my laptop and I don't exactly know how to have a conversation with my laptop while I'm by myself
So this is gonna be, um how do you call it, a try?
Um, so here we go.
So I'm pretty sure we have a lot of SoundCloud fans that actually don't have a Twitter, Tumblr, or an Instagram or anything such as that.
Cause I'm sure that a lot of you just discovered my music through SoundCloud and probably don't know how to get in contact with me.
So here's how we're gonna, here's how we're gonna keep in contact for those of you that actually, like diehard fans.
Cause I'm pretty sure a lot of our diehard fans don't have the main social networks.
So what I want you guys to do is either download Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even Snapchat.
And I'm gonna give you each of my names and I'm gonna put em in the, in the description and I'm gonna put my partners' names and I'm gonna, like different, different people that I'm working with
Or whatever you guys want from me.
I'm gonna start answering questions through Tumblr so if you wanna get in contact with me to have a conversation, you're gonna contact me through Tumblr.
If you want to, I mean just look at what the fuck I'm thinking and have a comment on what I'm thinking, that would usually be on Twitter.
Um, Instagram obviously is just, just photos
I mean the extent to it's just a DM, I see pretty much where I check is the DM's is why I go on Instagram. So if you wanna get in contact with me, again, Instagram.
My, I'll give you contact to my manager so that way you can contact my managers easier if you have a line of business that you want to contact me for. Please only contact if it is for business.
What, I mean as far as the shows we have, what's the shows we have coming up?
We have one in West Palm, West Palm Beach on Friday with Wifisfuneral.
And then I have a, I have a show with my partner the day after and also with my partner Pollari, Kevin Pollari.
I mean if you wanna come to those shows, those are the dates.
Friday, West Palm Beach, myself and Wifisfuneral.
And Saturday, I'll be attending my partner's show in, what is it, Miami?
Well, so yeah it's in Wynwood, Miami.
So what I need you guys to do is go on our social networks and follow us.
So for Twitter, my social network name would be what my artist name is on SoundCloud.
X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N
For, I'll give you Instagram, for Instagram: heroinfather, H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
For Snapchat, theheroinfather, T-H-E-H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
Tumblr, xxxtentacion.tumblr.com, so X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N, dot tumblr, T-U-M-B-L-R, dot com.
And, um, I'm pretty sure that'd be it.
Alright, well, on a different note, here's what I'll cover. We'll call it "a helping hand."
Damn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.
For those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?
A little bit not in tune with what's going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like you're just following whatever is right in front of you
Here's what I call a helping hand, here's how I'll help you do it:
With whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.
So say for instance you see money in your life and that's what you want more of.
The more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.
People think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.
Or these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but it's literally what it is.
So, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.
The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.
And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.
[*glitch*]
Woah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didn't pause.
Yeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.
Whatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?
What you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.
So if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.
There's no simpler way-holy shit.
Shouts out to Teflon Sean.
You need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.
But yeah, also, study the Golden Beetle.
With that being said, goodbye.


I dream so much and I just can't seem to find an answer for what I'm living for in general
I can't keep living like this, its breaking my heart day by day
I mean who's to say you find an answer when there isnt?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a dream?
What if we live for no reason?
What if we just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life?
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplation
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please save me


There was blood in my tears
I heard so many complaints to remember
I will never change
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Break!
Yeah (she said, she said)
Yeah

If the seasons change
Will you remain the same?
Oh, how I love the cold
Because of you I'll never know
Gold teeth in a flask (yeah)
Many men without a soul
But the fall is all we know, yeah it's all we know
I look forward to the ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Break
I will never change, I will never break, yeah
Break, yeah

Many men are of a dying breed.
Plunge the knife into his throat and suck the blood of human out it's case, dangerous.

I observe the father, walk into an alley,
Probably go in just to take a piss.
Slowly, surely, I will take position,
Without hesitation, I will grab his wrists. (yeah)
Chop him, buck him, fuck him,
I will stab him, splat him, drag his body all across the map.
Shower in his fluids,
Kiss him, bite him, eat him.
Threw a fit, and then I take a nap

Butterflies,
Kidney stones,
Slit wrists
Vagabond.
Concubine,
I'm alone,
Very holy when I'm not alone.

Different person when she texting, guess her heart was hurting
She need attention I'm guessing I didn't get the message
She told me "Bae, I know you miss me, why you still pretending?"
Louie loafers, Fendi, and different colors matching
She leave her house like she winning a fucking beauty pageant
And when she older, she told me she wanted to be an actress

Lost friend feelin' shitty, called pissy sissy
Broad feelin' like death or when I'm ready

Bullets like I'm fetty
Ax to the brain
Drugs for the pain
How you feel the same ma?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slit
Knot then we hang

Make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch

Hip-hop's a jungle, nah

You see my raps became subordinate
Posting portraits of flow and gin
More the note of the porridge
Than more anointed than ordain
More annoyed than an orphan
From Corbin who's often orphanos
And snorting some block detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexi's open for fucking
Fuck it I'm ducking, and trucking off to New Zealand
I'm wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pill and feeling like villain
Haha

Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go
So in my grave I'll rot

Alright, I found this sound in Stockholm
The comfortin' I feel with it
It's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel it?

So if I escape
Will my pain go away?
This thing should be needless to say
I walk in my mind and I wonder
But till death the inferno, I plunder
Action misleading the spared
There is a home, but with nobody there
In debt with the darkness for years and the centuries
A body is hidden, so you ought to envy
Your actions are covered in sin
But you've never felt so alive
If you think that you're leaving, you're wrong
You've not a choice but to die

Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep (Now, ayy)
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep (Ayy, ayy)
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep
There is no escape (Envy this)
There is no escape
There is no escape

I found this sound in Stockholm
So comfortin'
I feel, I feel as if it's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel this?


As a fair warning to everyone listening to this song
I advise you to not hide your feelings
Don't pretend to be okay when you're not okay
Don't pretend to be happy when you're sad
It'll only lead to your misery

Don't you fucking hate it when you hear my name?
I feel the same and when you hear this you gon' feel the pain
And all these niggas that you fuckin' with to get away
But girl I know you think about it almost everyday
And I'll be honest I be jealous of these niggas, true
How you feelin' with these niggas that you talk to?
Captivated by your mind and your walk too
Can't replace you with these bitches that I talk to
They say "lust is love" we had trust, what's good?
I should've held you close
Should've kept you warm
And when the rain is fallin', wonder who you call
Don't pray to god, you rather drive your car
Don't talk
Pretend it don't hurt
Repent, I won't stomp, my feet in a rage
My nigga I'm no chump
This issue when I crave you, hate you
You think I'd rip the wings off of my fuckin' angel
It don't hurt, damn

It'll be alright soon
I'll forever be the, I'll forever be the elephant in the room
I'll always love you, I'm sorry

["News"]

Alright, I'm coming up
Any nigga that doubted me, I'm coming up
Any hctib that looked down on me, I'm coming up
I stand out, I do my tihs
I'm always been on my tihs
I do this for my mom, I do this for my brother, I do this for my fam
I'll kcuf anybody that says otherwise, case closed, my nigga

Mmh

Eh ya, mmh, eh
So this how the story go
Ow, eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem rising
Rising, rising
Eh eh
Den gon dem fallin', fallin', fallin'

He showin' signs of corruption
Then went from somethin' to nothin'
He put his hands on his mother
And now he's fuckin' his cousin
Now she's havin' his baby
The bitch is driving him crazy
The motherfucker was violent
'Cause he was fresh out the Navy
She dealt with constant abuse
Never revealing the truth
She kept the feelings concealed
Until they rose to the roof
A war starts, heart drop, 'cause she was tied to the bed
She said she thought it was over, he put a gun to her head
But listen

All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I d-i-e, all you niggas just p-i-e
Nah nigga can't sleep on me, ah ah
But listen
All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I d-i-e, all you niggas just p-i-e
Nah nigga can't sleep on me

Sleep with a knife by your bed
So convinced she got a gun to her head
Only relief is when she's taking the meds
Or taking Henny instead
Taking liquor to her belly in bed
Until her belly is red
Now she's findin' out the baby is dead
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she's got no cure
And she want more

Eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem rising
Rising, rising
Eh eh
Den gon dem fallin', fallin', fallin'

About a quarter to noon
He started roaming these streets
Left her tied back home
Her mouth was covered with sheets
He started making observations from starting the conversations
Pill pop, left himself with no options
'Cause his mind is made and he keeps counting his days
Rather than smoking, the nigga simply going insane
Tied himself to the bridge as it began to occur
Fuck, I couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur
Guess it's the drugs that made the nigga absurd
Thin-thin-thinking 'bout the past and all the things that he learned
But then it came to a turn
Started thinking evil thoughts in the burn
Ran for years and now the thought has retur—

["Flock"]

Pussy popper
Young Waka Flocka

Get your mind right, only way a nigga coolin' if I get high, right?

Skinny motherfucker, won't you tell me where the cash at?

They say "X is just a city bitch", ya feel me
But it's not really gon' be that bad

Rap rigorous
Ace the plate, kill this shit
Pace is great, villainous
Filling the plate
Pissing all over you pussy pedestals
Skeptical, little edibles
Spread 'em, and I'ma wet em
Forget 'em, I'll never let 'em, reread 'em
No scope, they scatter
Coke flow, like batter
But drain like batteries
All you niggas is calories
Get burned, this finger, your bitch squirm
You're bigger, as just learned
Your nigga should take turns
I pop that pussy like an adderall
Niggas will act as if they powerful
But got they backs against the wall
And ever the flick of my niggas the bigger my niggas
And pass the stretcher
Part of the reason I fuck this all up in this second and pass the pitcher
Mr. Mr. get ya coke slang like Mrs.
Like Mike Vick, I'm vicious and misfit
Don't fit like fitness, my wrist
This on fleek shit, my wrist on slit bitch
My dick my dick met
Shit like ass-crack
Piss my slit with' slow to fight back
Niggas in Chiraq, shooting like Iraq
Death to Jah's soldiers, bust your kneecaps
I came to murder you niggas, no need to fight back
No need to fight back
No need to fight back, yeah


[XXXTENTACION:]
Pick litter the middle of six niggas is bitter
As dick lickers as licking the cliques clitoris
Vigorous black bags and the vividus black casper
And back the bash faster
Better, mean cash or with cassidy
And the passenger packin the shovel
Rackin up bodies, quicker than calories salaries
Mean spend it and vend it a pussy magnet and stagnant
And quick fragments of faggots
Who's clique blackin' with cactuses
And the package delivered
Fuckin' synonym cinnamon covered synonyms
Get' em got em'
Killin em killable fuckin liberal kidabble
Litta fucka' then suck a condom and couple looking with therapy
Office and officer
Of accomplishing condominets
Any converse is commonly
Incompetent prominence
Get a communist but-
They never understand
How it feels to be a man
How it feels to be a man, hmm

As soon as you're in let them all know who they're in the presence of

I am a murderer, I am a demon, a son of a serpent
What is your faith, what is your worth have you felt acknowledgement
If I kill you now, will you go heaven or hell you believe in
Death is approaching you
Thirty seconds, think before lying in a blood sea

Grippin that pistol grip
Yo' bitch is submissin' so I make her pistol grip
Murder and kill her jits

Cock in her mouth to show you what I'm bout
Yes I fucked her then made that bitch shoot her kids
Three heads like cerberus, geeked off adrenaline
Feelin like Shaq, I'm a dunk on the pig
He dirty like derby, she suck me like kirby
I murder the fucker then eat on her clit
I fantisize 'bout a Japanese bitch
She fantasize about sucking my dick
She wanna be famous, for shaking her anus
I told her to Kim K and fuck on the flip

I got the pistol grip
I'm down to pistol whip
Yes, I got the pistol
Yes, I got the pistol bitch

Got a 40 Glock and that drum niggas
So when I shoot the shit they go aye

Burn the fucker
Never yearned the fucker
I'ma leave the body in Dubai
Aye


I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
Your pussy was there for me, was there for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm having withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you stand for me, you done to me
That pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one
Your only one
I know I was wrong
Fuck, but that pussy was ecstasy, ecstasy
I want you right under me
Te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck with everything, everything


Luke White on the beat!

You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice"
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views" and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—

We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings
We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!
We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!
You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America, the niggers are taking it over and the Jews
Make a stand, join the klan
White power! White power! White power!
And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!
I hate them because they breathe!
I hate them because they're scum!
The goddamn niggers are the scum of the earth!
White power!


Yeah, I'm a creative genius
And there's no other way to word it
I know you're not supposed to say that
About yourself and I say things the wrong
Way a lot of times but my intention,
Is always positive
"You're... you're a genius, you really are... you're a genius"
I know

Black ski, gold teeth
Gold teeth, fingerless,
Blasphemous, wrists are slit,
I kissed the bitch,
Blood on my lips,
Holy shit, he scared the bitch,
I grabbed her bra and tell her she can,
She can... she can...

Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Oh no...
Error

Kill a fuck nigga make em' write what they know

Very Rare savage make a fuck nigga bleed

Dance up in that pussy, watch me [?]
Error

Sever the mind
Wonder what you'll find within the souls divine
Put 'em on ice
Watch the nigga slip, think he will not suffice
Make 'em idle, all to be infamous
Time becomes a fucking rival
Basically battled the devil within himself
He faced the fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face, I hate this place
Goddamn, disgusted by my face
I feel like a waste of damn skin because the tint that's on my face


Ayye, haha, yuh

FUCK out my way, Johnny Cage face kick
I might lose my mind, I can't ever love a bitch
Face that dope, fuck a vote, fuck Trump
When that nigga win, put his body in the trunk
I eat the flesh off an enemy, liver lookin' oh so fuckin' good me, yuh, aye
Menace is the only fuckin' friend of me, aye, yuh
Fuck that shit, I need Hennessy, yuh, aye
Wave lookin' like mass genocide, aye
World War X, I got men in line
Fuck my life, I don't wanna live
Death before dishonor I am not a pig?

Suicide pit! Suicide pit! Suicide pit! Suicide pit!
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up, yuh
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up! [x2]

The evolution is near
The brains will start to abandon their religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Yeah

I behead a motherfucker for his context
Take the body where the others can't see
Seen the devil in my eyes without them contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea
Yuh, narcissistic crucifixion
Dead weight, I been searching
Niggas coexist, you just don't see 'em work with other bitches
It's me, black and white, the dark of night
That's when I do my searching
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind
The evolutions lurking

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Scott James:]
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed

[xXXTENTACION:]
Forgive what's said in fear
And all I ask of you is hear
The girl with the golden heart
I killed from the inside out at dawn
The sun has only just arose
Cannot heal all the hearts that I've broke
The boy with the broken heart
His goal is to rip everything apart

[Scott James:]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

The oars start sinking
When you let go
To use your hands while speaking
Something I'll never let us float

Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

I must have caught your cold
I could not sleep at all
I'm clinging on for hope
I need you as I'm close


Hey there you, looking for brighter season
Need to lay your burden down
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling
Buried under deeper ground

I seem depressed, always being bothered never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a cheque
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast

Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
Fear of understanding, the Devils running his course
Pitchers not receivers, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Minds full of greed exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards
Everybody is superficial, only breaching the surface
Surface, upon the Earth
Flames engulf the Earth
And prized possession they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when that heaven gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath
Try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinion then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then, cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, accurate fact put the black in fact
If you thought that, you are free, you should disregard that
All fact

Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
My hypothesis, is, death ain't shit
I'd rather die than be alive in this life

Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumblin'
Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumblin'
Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumblin'
Through the sky, through-through the sky

Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

Through the sky, through-through the sky
Through the sky, through-through the sky
Through the sky, through-through the sky


God...
Who the fuck is...
Who the fuck is...
Ay...

[XXXTENTACION:]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling it up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull
And so...
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Torture victims and duty
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so

Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men
Innocent
See, living for a reason I don't know
Fuck shit hoe

[xxxRamze:]
Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as the eagle takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down to my knees
Bow down to my knees
Fuck that
Smoke that DMT

You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends
Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it
Now let me take you back to the story, that I once told
Ay, ay, that I once told...


Fucking bitches with my Go Pro
Pida la Vida I won't go broke
All of these bitches they want hard core
Pussy you talking but won't fade I know
I need the coke I can't cope, hope
Dive in that pussy and I slow stroke
Triple the x
I might triple the cup
I might double it up
I might no scope
I might bedazzle my pistol, aye
"X you're a goon what's your issue?" Aye
Diamonds electric like Raichu, aye

Hollow tips all in my rifle, aye

Double up, aye

Double up, aye
Double up, aye
I just brought them bitches need a double cup, aye
I just brought 2 bitches need a double cup


And hell is just a government creation
And all the information they solicit isn't nearly close to truth
It was clear since the alteration
Of the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America, oh, the ultimatum
Of telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell
I'm tired of havin' patience
So I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you
Jesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don't understand why J. Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets
But didn't mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool
I'm absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers
Tie your throat to a truck bed and pedal the metal quickly


Shooting guns just like it's heroin
Deep in the pussy like a body burial
Bitch underwater, what I name her? Ariel
Cutie booty, I'ma fuck her up the uh, woo
I wanna fuck on your mouth
I wanna fuck on your daughter, your house
I wanna make that bitch pussy my spouse
She wear Giuseppe, she open her mouth

I put bricks on a bitch, thirty xans off her tits
I put molly on that bitch, I put molly on that bitch
I put bricks on a bitch, thirty xans off her tits
I put molly on that bitch, I put molly on that bitch

Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me that's okay, that choppa on me get the Jumpman

Your girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah I said it and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, and get high on this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
Dude, I do that shit on purpose, suicide in that bitch
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche
We kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck yo bitch on camera and call that shit a hardcore
Hard porn, Sharper than hard poons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so they choppas actin' like brooms
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon
Pull up on the scene, that's just me
Hey, switch that shit up real quick
I may come back to that, I don't know


I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

I told her that her secret safe with me
I told her that her loveis all I need
Her soul, I'll keep it, helps me sleep
Helps me Rest In Peace
I've been to high off [?]
Lord knows I don't got any other friends
I befriended the drugs again
I fell in love with the plug again
I put it under the rug again
I'm drownin' in a cup full of mud again
Cross my heart and hope I don't give in

I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Ooh, ooh
What do I do, this shit's so suicidal
Percocets, in my vitals
Bible of the rival, that's all I know
Codeine got a nigga mind froze
Codeine got a nigga time slow
The devil in the red dress kills
They told me not to take the red pill
I took the red pill and the blue pill
Last night was to real

I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to god that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin'
These niggas makin' assumption, me, I'm just makin' this money
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate", nah
I did this all by myself so I don't need nobody's help, shit
I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel
You can catch 20 shells, you a fat person, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, Seinfeld
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my 40, it came from my plaster
That shit is a blessing, I leave you in the past tense
I rap to wrappin' plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outta space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, yo bitch in my left hand
And her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it'll come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pant pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside the clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me cause it go, oof!
Next beat, next beat, I may come back
Next part, what should I kill? Cool


I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing, love, you're my everything

It's funny when they tell me I'm a sad boy
Then why you think I'm using all the drugs for
Cracked a Benz while I'm lookin' to the Benz track, (ha)
I won't be sad no more
Somewhere down the line I'll meet a sad girl
Next thing you know she in my bed
Next thing you know she in my room
Next thing you know she in my head

Let's add a little drama to the scene
This is when I tell you that I love you when you leave
This is when you told me that I don't mean anything
Then that's where I told you that you were my everything

I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing, love, your my everything

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him

Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on?, I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acappella
I could give you want you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me, see me smoke a million (SESH)

Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him


I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you Is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty I wish to explore your features secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you back to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got no where to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'


I know that it hurts sometimes, but It's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wan' see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feeling philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, will you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
Comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room


You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why

Ohhhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Noooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhhh, fuck is you talkin' bout my shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole for eternity so they can reap what they sow
Ohhhh, I don't think I can do nothing but flow
Noooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhhh, I don't know why you in love with me hoe
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist

I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why


I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So lets laugh a little 'fore I'm gone
I've been dreaming of this shit for awhile now
Got me high now
She don't love me but she's singing my song
Oh no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walking home alone I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it getting high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high I be fucking with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the morning with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

Running away from me but I'm not giving up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me but I'm not giving up on you no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things


Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You weren't there
(Skrrt)

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me

I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me
Now you acting like a ghost and that's okay I know I'm ugly
Now I'm swerving in the ghost and I'm okay I'm getting money
Now I'm switching up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothing
Give me some time and give me your patience
Came in the game last one month, fuck the game I'm done
Give me a sign and I'm going to take it
Whatever way I want
Bitch I get payed up front
I'm getting mine so fuck all your placements
Baby face I'm done
Fuck the place I'm from
Don't hit my line and say something basic
If it ain't about the money
Please don't waste no time
Looking out the edge, and I'm picturing the fall
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Put it in my bong then I make another song


Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

Don't stutter, slang from the gutter, gotta' bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shining thru' the shutter
Say she over me, whatever cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad, you don't, you won't, not never,
Stop blowing up my phone

You wanna run that shit back for me?

Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers


I use to dream of you
Na,I use to lose my sleep for you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck witchu
I use to scream at you
I use to turn my cheek at you
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck bout me
And I ain't nothing to you
I'm just looking at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain,But I don't never complain
I'm insane I'm deranged,I see your face at the rain
This ain't no race for the fame,But at this pace I'ma make it
Face it,you basic, Lil Peep you're replacement
I'm taking your spot
I'll give it back when I'm raking the gwap
Maybe not
I keep on checking statements
I'm checking for payments
While you checking ya plays bitch

I been doing my own thing lately
I been holdin my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They  asking me how it feel,I say it's crazy
[x2]


When I'm coming down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again..

If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breaking down again..

But if I need to go
Just to show you I don't fucking care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
And I won't fucking stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you..

You notice me [x4]
You know its me [x4]

It's me

My arms are searching for you
My arms are stretched out towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you


Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl
I'm all on my own
I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this
Putting my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flying bitch
Breaking my bones
You breaking my bones you want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me cause it help me forget
I ain't go put up no time
If you ain't got time if I ain't gon' bitch
I'm doing my thing
and bitch I can see all the disrespect in front of my face
Step in this bitch let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smoking on something imo dip
Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I need you
I wont pick up the phone
Just know that I need you


Laying on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, tryna take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thracks, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwing shade like you finna face me
You were always bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch I got plenty in my bottle it say Remy on my belt
That shit say Fetti in the back, green (bling)

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb cause they give me all their brains

Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Driving fast when she listening to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime pussy make me happy

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins


Damn son, where'd you find this?

Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make her frumpet cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
Get my face recognised
We can do anything
Worth, greed, memory
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make a grown man cry cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wanna be


Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice put the blame on you

(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death)
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice then its shame on u

Where did you go this time
What if I lose my mind
What if I make you cry
What if I die
What if I end my fucking life


I'mma take my time when I'm in it
I'mma make my mind up by tonight
No I can't die when I'm singing
I could live forever, way past the mic

These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony


I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money getting tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't picking up a call, mirror on the wall

I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall


[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
She said she ain't never coming back
She ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put u on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than..
See you leave just like the rest..
(See you leave just like the rest..)
Damn..

[Yung Goth:]
Lately, I've been dying lately

I've been dying lately
Lately, lately..
I've been dying lately

I've been dying lately, lately, lately
I've been dying lately
Gettin high lately
Gettin high lately
Lately, baby
(please don't worry) baby
Always tryna blame me
You ain't tryna save me
Save me, lately
Gettin high, tasty
Now I'm on that same shit
I've been dying lately
Lately, baby

[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down


[Lil Skil:]
I can see it in your eyes, that u wanna get high
I can see it in your eyes, that u need it right now
How you need it right now
How you wanna get high
How you need it right now
How you wanna good bye..

[Lil Skil & Lil Peep:]
I just wanna hear a sign from the narrow side of town
Baby we grillin' right now (woah)
Yeah I just wanna feel alive, baby take your time
Smoking on the spot (woah)

[Lil Peep:]
Girl you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me that's the best part baby the trust
Trust me
I got nothing for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie till the sun came up
All the places that you took me no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me now they on my nuts


My time is here and I'm making it clear
Oh I love you my dear
But I'm going, I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die I'mma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time but I never wanna do that again
Nothing worse than losing a friend
And the feeling you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waiting for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all


I been spending time
Time after time
Tryna get my mind right
But I just find I been lyin
Lying to myself
I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own
Baby I could handle mine
I could multiply..
I could satisfy..
Anybody tryn' see me shine
Man that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind
You been on my line
That's the reason why
I been working hard
You could stand aside
I could never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe

That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe [x2]


Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, hoe
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, hoe
I got problems with your motherfuckin' god

I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
But you got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burning down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(baby I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream
(baby I need you)


Ice in your veins
Blood in your brain

And I thought I should say
That I still love u like I did back in two thousand and eight
Okay

You know he can't do what I do
Yeah It's true
Girl I think I'm dying real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Ima keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wasting my time
Giving you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin truck out (skrr)
Trying to buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

Let me bleed, watch me die

She's my fantasy, she only comes at night
She don't know 'bout me, what goes on inside
I'll let you feel my pain if you would get me high
Had to make my name, I had to break my spine
Now I'm on my way, I'm just lookin' for pain
Bitches fuck me the same, it don't matter the place, okay

Tell her that I love her while my brother cry
I don't got the time for no compromise
Bitch, I need it all, I'ma make it mine

I can't feel that much sometimes

Disappear into my mind where I can't feel a thing
When the sky falls down, no one here can think that clearly
I'll be by your side, let's get high one last time

I don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now
But I gotta leave it alone
Is it cause I'm hot now, it's probably cause I'm hot now
Bitch you better leave me alone
First I cut you off then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around
I don't never come around

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speeding down the highway, looking at the street lights
Geeking on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowing I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I should've curved you, I know I'm the worst boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe I swear she love getting high to
I love getting high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm making music to cry too

I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you acting like a ghost girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights getting high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone
I'm dying, I don't think that my bitch know

I don't think that my bitch know

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same

Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna come back to you
I know, I did a little blow and I never wrote back to you
My love, I wanna give it all to you
Baby I just wanna ball with you
I could see the air was coming near the way I do
About you now

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same


[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal:]
Running up that hill, you pushin' me back
Think that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Because I don't know (I dunno)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
Fore me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It's the way, it is the way it really seem
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passing on and out
(And out, and out)
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt

[Lil Peep:]
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn't something 'til you brought it up
I knew that you were trying to make it out
Without a single scar, clawing at my arm
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbing on top of me
Why you acting like you fucking forgot me?
I've been dreaming about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I'm moving to Hollywood


Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first

Lying on the asphalt, Lil Peep blacked out
Fucking with the coatway, let my Mad Max out
I be on some real shit, get it from my OG
I don't wanna hear shit, shawty what she told me
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I be on my lonely
Looking for the right girl, why you all up on me?
Love me for a night, girl, hate me in the morning
Yeah I know your type girl, so I make her blow me
Lil Peep

Look me in my eyes, girl
Tell me if you think that it's a lie, girl
Getting tired of your girl
I know I need my own girl, my girl
[x2]

Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first


[Lil Peep:]
I just wanna see you smile, I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true
I'll be on my own, no crew
Out here making these moves
Singing these big city blues
I don't wanna think about you
Every time I think about you
I swear I fall in love again
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Coldhart

[Coldhart:]
And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beating heavy for me
And I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you got stars for eyes
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sitting drinking whiskey, hoping that you miss me
Baby say you do (please say you do)
Maybe say you do


Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
[x2]

Love now, cry later, cry later
But I always take the chance
But I always take the chance
If I could save her
If I could save her
She said she got other plans, damn

Hotel rooms and skyscrapers

She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts

But that's okay, she always pick out me

I be in The Bay, I be in LA
I be on stage, bitches kissing on my face
What I'm tryin to say
Let's take it by the day
I'm the one you want, not the one you trying to save
I got a broken heart, you were like a blade
Tearing me apart, but I kinda like the pain
She like it when it rain
She like that I'm insane
I like it that she gay
She like me for my brain
Lil Bo Peep

Looking at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud

And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't getting nothing but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me


[Slug Christ & Lil Peep:]
Whooaa, it's Slugga, Peep and Tracy

Don't lie, don't lie
Don't lie, don't lie

[Lil Peep:]
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl, you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name

[Lil Tracy:]
True Religion jeans, pockets full of cocaine
Tattoos on my face, I'mma die this way
I don't wanna talk, so I flex and I finesse
Only inhale the best, exhale the stress
Used to be broke, I cast a spell on my check
Ice on my neck, now my ex sends me texts
Ask me if I still love her, I'm on xans, I forget
Bitch, did you forget? You cut through me like a wrist
I'm finna get rich, snortin' coke in a Benz
You don't know my name, you don't know my pain
On the highway to hell in a Beamer, switchin' lanes
Six hundred sixty six kisses on your face
Baby, now that I'm gone, do you hallucinate?
And see me in your room with that Gucci on my waist?
I'm so far away, now I'm in L.A
Gothic bitch, skinny waist, pussy drippin' like cocaine

[Lil Peep:]
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl you don't know my name
If I gotta I'mma wait in the rain
Girl you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl you don't know my name

[Slug Christ:]
She talkin' got me soddin' in shame, girl, you drive me insane
Only you can occupy any space in my heart and in my brain
I fade away in saturated gray
It's just one way to numb it all away
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain killer
Snort it all away for a second, I'll feel better
Fake ass bitches plottin' on a Young Slugger
Diamorphine and I'm self medicatin', yeah
See different, you said you felt the same
Girl, I thought you knew my pain


[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby, watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall
I'll cop it all, castle halls

[Lil Tracy:]
Baby, I'm an asshole, walkin' thru my castle
I can break your heart, baby, I know it's so fragile
Step inside my castle, we blowin' on that good dope
Put this in your nostril, baby, I got good blow
Fuck her, then I vanish, disappear like magic
I live lavish, Gucci sheets all on my mattress
Goth Boy Clique, skrrt skrrt in a black whip
Pullin' down her skirt, I know you want it, you can't have it
Welcome to my castle, it's just me and you tonight
I think you're an angel, just a human in disguise
This is not rap, it's a goth lullaby
I'll be in your dreams every time that we get high
Lie, lie, lie, all you ever do is lie
Look me in my eyes like the stars in the sky
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die

[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall
I'll cop it all, castle halls

Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Took her to the crib and I show her how I die
Every night, then I wake up and I'm still fuckin' high
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby pour another cup
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby pour another cup
Ayo

[Lil Tracy:]
I just dropped a pill in my champagne
She said she love me she don't even know my real name
Hoppin' out the Uber on a Friday
Gothic bitch, her Gucci bag got bags of cocaine
I've been living life my way
I can't fuck with you if we weren't friends on Myspace
Lord why, Lord why do I wanna die?
I'mma get a Maserati just to take my life inside
Baby sip this wine, tell me are you down to ride
Cause when I get a castle I won't let no one inside
I'm so magical my wrist glisten in your dreams
Skinny nigga up next countin' guap with LiL PEEP, yah

[Lil Peep:]
I had no one by my side
Till this pretty young white bitch hopped up in my ride
Took her to the crib and I show her how I die

So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory
Can this be him, this hellboy?

Show after show, fucking hoe after hoe

Please just hold me one time

Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane
I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight

[Lil Tracy:]
Look in the mirror
I see a demon, I'm barely breathing
My shadow is bleeding
On the highway, baby, I'm speeding
I'm leavin' the city, you should be with me
Two weeks with the same old jeans on
I know you want to die, baby, this is your theme song
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on

[Lil Peep:]
All this stress
Look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead
Dyin' out west
Tryin' my best
Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane
I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight


[Lil Peep:]
Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique make a hoe shake
Black fur, black coat
Gothboiclique in the back hoe
Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique till my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
Gothboiclique in the castle

[Lil Tracy:]
In high school I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on

[Lil Peep:]
When I die bury me with all my ice on
When I die bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
When I die bury me with all my ice on
When I die bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Lil Tracy:]
Clothes off baby I got good white
Tell me a secret, and I'll tell one of mines
I just wanna talk, I don't wanna fight
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?

[Lil Peep:]
Switchblades, cocaine

[Lil Peep:]
Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you
Left the drugs behind for you
I can't help you make it through, that's what I do
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go

[Lil Tracy:]
Here we go again, wakin' up again
I know a lot of shit, but I don't know what day it is
I really like you, but I'ma die fast
So you should run away, and don't look back
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up baby I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood
I was wide awake, you were havin' a nightmare
You said you think that you're in Hell, I'll catch a flight there
I'll be right there, for you
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up, baby, I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood

[Lil Peep:]
Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you
Left the drugs behind for you
I can't help you make it through, that's what I do

Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go

[Lil Peep:]
I know that you like me, kiss me with your eyes closed
Hate it when you fight me, love it when I die slow
She just wanna bite me, I could see your eyes glow
Kill me in my white tee, baby, let my blood flow
Let my blood flow, let my blood flow
We just havin' fun though
Now my blood froze, I can see the sun hoe
You're the one hoe, lookin' for my love though
Where my love go, baby, where my gun go?

Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
Goth Boi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

Popping pills, thinking about you

I was used to you
"What have you been through?"
She asked me
Every fucking kind of abuse

If you love me too,
You would give me you
Lock me in your room,
Don't tell me the truth

Everything you said,
Stayed inside my head
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I try to go, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind, I been on my own since age nine

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
