[SZA:]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking
Foolish of me to think I had it
Emmanuel, how foolish of me
To think I had it..
I hear your voice behind me
Moving up my neck
I hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breathe, breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming
Just do it
Yeah yeah yeah, I hear you talking
Yeah yeah yeah, feel you moving
Lets do it, yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah

[SZA & XXXTENTACION:]
Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me

Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self infliction
Blood stains in my gold plates, without a soul, impure hate
Insecure ay, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine (Ah! Ah!)
History, mystery, hate her, fuck him
What's meant to me?
Was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt (Fuck!)
Ice Hotel

[XXXTENTACION:]
Ice, ice, ice
Feel the love in the air,
Hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, legislate for eight
Seven virgins
Swerve and converge
Her rapes lurking, curtain
Covered sins soon rest unwritten
Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel

And I, could've been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And I, could've been
Dead, boy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
Just face the abyss, and I (aye!)
Place blame for this shit
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that's the gist
First, you can see it on me, I'm pissed
Lost in the mist, pants full of piss
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies

Thy Kingdom come
I should've set it free but I...

[xxxtentacion:]
Hush little angel, don't say a word
Bottle full of pills, passed out on the curb
Sun brings heat and it just won't snow
Noose like a necklace on my neck, won't go
I was too slow 'cause I won't understand
Blade for your cries, count a penny for my sins
WiFi's off and the lake don't stream
Wrist down the river, not across, wanna bleed

Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay

Wake up to your face
I'm straight forward, fuck a pace
What I wanted just so happened to be you
Couldn't picture being a moment in your shoes
When I think back to the kidney failures
Broken promise, I failed
I won't deny it, I held the ground you walk on
Heart stops, you walk away
You're good today, you're gone tomorrow
I carry my heart on my face, I'm so depressed
What good is sex?
I pray that you would love me less
And now it's here, hand on my chest

Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay
Grow your wings, fly away, fly away, fly away
You don't wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay


Star fall, fear calls waiting on you I'd never run
Kiss, fuck, I won't feel I doubt that I would ever want
Hold me, kiss me, fuck me, you don't wanna love
Haunt me, hang me, love me I don't ever love

There's an Elephant In this Room
There's an Elephant In this Room

There she was with the blade in her hand
Scars on her skin replace kiss of the man
She's played a part for as long as she's known
Regret fills her heart as her love leaves her home
She's learnt to be passive but such is a loss
Accepting defeat when I foreclose the cause
For her, this was needed to be rid of the pain
You play the victim, I'll play it sane

Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists till my heartbeat is silent
Shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

Stomp out that fucker his death will be slow
You made me do this just as far as you know
If you don't exist then my pain can be rid
So I gut the fucker then eat like a pig

Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists till my heartbeat is silent
Shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump
Offense or defense, passive or violent
I'll cut my wrists till my heartbeat is silent
Shell in my hand, I'm equipped with the pump
Shots in her body until she is a stump

I am the heart marksman

Where you said you were going
He can't fuck you like I can
He can't fuck you like I can [x4]

I don't remember much
I just seen her dead in there
It definitely stood out
I remember your smell when I touched you
How you used to talk to me
It all hurts so much now
How could I waste so much time on someone who doesn't even love me
Even though all the time I spent, its just worthless
Now I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore
Save me

Indeed I am ready, my outfit in vain

King of the dead, I sever your head
When shit touch the river, my reign will be fed
I touch the sky and bring life to the dead

Found this out in Sweden, a while ago
It's like, the more I explore the song, the more-
I explore different sounds, period
It's like the more I fall in love with making music
It's nice, actually

I'm out my mind, see fear in your eyes
I'm sick, I despise myself again
The tears never come, my body is numb
I feel like a god amongst the men
Cut out my eyes, feed me with lies that I don't never have to see again
I feed the hate, I feed the truth, I give the pain to the youth
Fuck the devil for your wealth, pistol chilling on my shelf
I control my own death, I don't need no fucking help

[Marilyn Manson, Bill O'Reilly & XXXTENTACION:]
You can take some of your lyrics as you know, you'll understand when I'm dead. I mean, these disturbed kids can take these lyrics and say, "You know when I'm dead, everybody's going to know me."
Well, I think that's a very valid point, and I think that that's a reflection of a -not necessarily this program, but of television in general. If you die and enough people are watching, then you become a martyr, you become a hero, you become well-known. So when you have things like Columbine and you have these kids that are angry and they have something to say and no one's listening, the media sends a message that if you do something loud enough and it gets our attention, then you will be famous for it. Those kids ended up on the cover of Time Magazine, the media gave them exactly what they wanted

I am a dog, girl abort
Shoot pregnant wife in a Porsche
That is expensive abortion
I ran it up, fuck a portion
Ain't had no family like orphans
Might sell some xans to the orphanage
On your face might stomp the yard
On my mom I'd catch a charge
Play with pussy like guitar
I'm the realest one thus far
You are just running, a candidate
Your girlfriend said you are minute man
Bitch, my traphouse, it got management

I got no heart I'm a manikin

Now since a jit I been in love with that fuck shit
40 clips causing white noise in her voice that she sniff no distortions
Half a fat check on my teeth like I'm Norbit
OG gas pack to contaminate lungs
Now I'm higher than orbits
Falling off like [?], put the force into her core
I'm the one like I'm Obi, forcing whores to forfeit
Come within my circle, we gone clip your vocals

[xxxtentacion:]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin [x3]
I got no heart, I'm a manikin
I got no heart, I'm a manikin


I see Black skies, and white lies I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me
Fueling my insecurities (as the ground right under me)
Crumbles if it wasn't there
It's too much
My hearts crushed
I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness because it's all lies
I've seen the pain
I run away so many times
Death and I are companions
He's here at all times
I won't love
Won't trust
I won't die
I can't feel but managed to steal your heart, love
It's dirt poor and I fuck whores who want love
It seems that anything offered can be enough but
It's time
Body falls so I don't know who to call at all
And my heart can't take on my broken soul
... I'm so fucking numb
My life has succumb to hate, Trinidad
Alone, in the snow


Stop, I don't usually be on this trap shit but
shout out my nigga Vinny Changos, rest in peace Roach

I'm in the trap spot, I need the high spot
I heard the door knock, it's time to sell the rock
Jit with the bleed, leave blood in my lean
The bitch a molly fiend, she like to fucking tweak
I hit it really far, like "where it go though"
He fucked a fan, a middle man and now she don't like me vro
the "we don't fight shit" how awful, damn bitch
I keep the tool cause I'm so vool, my nigga real real

We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

Lost in the pessimistic state of perception
It's been hard to participate in natural instances
And due to my history, I don't know what's next for me
But keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said
I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth

Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift to a place, where the devil lives
My soul rise to the sky, made of abyss
With the evidence, that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now
We tearing it down, we make these incredible sounds
We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

From everything you made
You try to erase
Memories will fade

[XXXTENTACION:]
I'm doing drugs so I can maintain
Part of the reason that I can handle this damn pain
"I'm fuckin' numb" said the lonely heart of the drummer boy
Who'd rather wreak havoc than play around with a Tonka toy
Uh, shit, my mirror ain't been clearer lately
I see my mind becoming blind, material mistaken
Heart indulging in the things that are forever broken
I seen a father lose his son, why life so fucking hopeless?
Uh, ayy, concept of my depression is
That there's no fucking recollection when your birth begins
And there's nobody there to hold you when the pain begins
But there's somebody there to fold you when you're caving in
Uh, yuh, such discussed by such and such
You're a fucking loser man, well life's a fucking uppercut
Right inside my fucking gut
Wanna fuckin' end it but
I don't have the balls to
Fuck, I'm such a pussy, fuck me up

Numbness and hell, what we crave right now
No, I can't feel no pain right now


[Kin$oul:]
Everlasting pain, blast my brain
Smokin' on dank, to hide my pain
I ain't gon' lie, shit won't change
Fuck the system, I ain't playing no games
Words like ammunition, click, clack position
One shot to your head, information was given
Nigga, shut up and listen
I'ma show you a vision
And take your mind on a mission and understand why you livin'
These niggas ass rappers, full-time actors
I can kill a track, even if I rap backwards
Fuck a studio, all a nigga need is a Macbook
And a little bit of drugs and a Backwood
And I'ma start spitting my pain
All of this shit in my brain
I don't think nothing's gon' change
But there's motherfuckin' money in the bank
Ooh, yeah, got my minds on some other shit
High as a mothership
Surprise, how I'm stuntin' bitch
Polite, with the pussy, I say "hi" when I'm comin' in
Talk all this shit, but the truth, you ain't got it bitch
Shawty hit me up, told her I will be there right away
Hide your partner pussy, pop a xanax, sleep my night away
Wake up, feelin' like this won't be the finest days
But it gets more better, smokin' the finest haze

Everybody stressin', lookin' for a blessing
Might just use a weapon, just to send a message
Everybody stressin', lookin' for a blessing
Might just use a weapon, just to send a message

[XXXTENTACION:]
And it always seem like all the fucking voices in my head
Is tryna see me dead, before I see my mother wed
And I remember way back when, when I was dead
Broke, I was a fucking joke
Nobody wanted to fuck with me
Remember sleeping on my nigga Will bed
Doing anything just to make sure his nigga fed
And now I'm recollecting all the fucking tears I shed
Just to get to where I am
And everybody wanna fuck with me
Remember bed bugs, bed sheets that felt like old rugs
And now we finally made it out the damn slums
Remember bitches actin' like old nuns
Now they pop they pussy like porn stars if a nigga want some
And that's a damn shame
I'm not ashamed, if you press my nigga Kin
Bullets rippin' through your damn brain
And that's for anybody fucking with my clique
I feel like Yeezy, 'cause ain't nobody fucking with my clique
Jah!

And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga
And I will never sleep on a fuck nigga
And I will never eat with a fuck nigga
My niggas aiming at you, better duck, nigga
If ya ain't about the fades, you better buck, nigga

17
My collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real life situations I've lived
17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head
My own personal number
Soon to be explained in future interviews or instances
By listening to this album, you are literally
And I cannot stress this enough
Literally
Entering my mind
And if you are not willing to accept my emotion
And hear my words fully
Do not listen
I do not value your money
I value your acceptance and loyalty
Here is my pain and thoughts put into words
I put my all into this
In the hopes that it will help cure
Or at least numb your depression
I love you
Thank you for listening
Enjoy

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

Trapped in a concept
Falsely accused
Misused, and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you fucking rest in peace
Now the fact that I'm alone is fucking comforting
And I can't seem to shake this fucking feeling in my...

The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck and the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
This is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
At all


Ooh ahh ahh
She showed me the things love can't forget
Oh it hurt now
Made a list of my regrets
And you were the first, love
Oh it hurts, I can't forget
How it hurt now, oh
Made a list of my regrets


Yeah
Oh my God, Ronny

It's a vibe, yeah, feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet, got a nigga throwed (Yuh, yuh)

[Donald Trump:]
But a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration
And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville
So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thank...

[XXXTENTACION:]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacing men
Will fucking swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart is gone in series of corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacing men

[XXXTENTACION (Donald Trump):]
Why the fuck should I apologize?
Countries orderless, it's a lie
By these fucking government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future
It's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
Where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind, the flies within our walls
I'm feeling like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, depending on people resembling Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it’s PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Donald Trump:]
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives
No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society
And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play

To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less but to say more, was ideal for this project, and till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show th- to open minds in a self was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again me entering your mind. feeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy. Enjoy.


I can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God, it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do? Where do I run?
I'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love
I dug my nails into my arms
She turned and laughed at all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left I question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth

Don't let me have to tell these niggas about the city I'm from
It's Brooklyn, be the home of hardest ever
Where them niggas don't aim, they just palm Berettas
And bomb whatever
Say we don't move calmly never, this for my niggas trapped in cells like salmonella
Look, I could do this shit with no effort, no pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxing these niggas extra

[Donald Trump:]
But a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration
And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville
So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thank...

[XXXTENTACION:]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends

Why the fuck should I apologize?
Countries orderless, it's a lie
By these fucking government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future
It's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
Where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind, the flies within our walls
I'm feeling like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, depending on people resembling Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it’s PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Donald Trump:]
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives
No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society
And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play

This brings the vibe of 17 straight into this new album and it's enough for people to be like okay, okay
Exactly exactly, so you don't have to give them 6, 7 songs that were the old vibe Yeah
Like if there was one that was the updated version of 17, yeah (Exactly)
Should this be number 1 on the album? (I don't know)
I feel like it's fire
I just, it might just be a hit to be honest, it might be a hit and like my mind
'Cause you're part of my energy now, so it's like when you hear a song from me it's almost like you're hearing the song from yourself so it's like you know my capabilities

Or it might, it might, so start- yeah yeah right, the perfect mix, the perfect mix (I hear what you're saying, it's gonna be like, yeah it gotta be like)
You should like a drop where it like, you should make a drop where it likes, "So in love"

[John Cunningham:] I'm recording this
[XXXTENTACION:] Yeah
[John Cunningham:] Just so I have it for reference
[XXXTENTACION:] Okay
[John Cunningham:]
What do you want? You know what I mean? This is your video, like you can create whatever you want
[XXXTENTACION:]
Like remember how I told you, like zoom into my eyes, then have it zoom out of the eyes and then we'll be in a different scene, we can really play on that and do like a lot of things
[John Cunningham:]
Well that it makes it way easier in terms of transitioning and terms of scenes
[XXXTENTACION:]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, all the-, each scene would zoom out of my eye and zoom into my eye, like I wanna be in the-, like this is gonna be green screen, right? We're gonna have to like, have like a chair, like a chair or a couch, right? And I want everything around me to be blacked out, like remember how in that one scene where I was like-, I was like-, I was like in the, um-, in like this blue place and shit, this time I want it to be all darkness
[John Cunningham:]
Like a massive, big black room where there's-, you don't know where the end is?
[XXXTENTACION:]
A-, a massive, big black room and you you don't know where-, where it is, and I'm like sitting-, and I'm sitting and there's a masked man in front of me, right? And they don't show his face, but you can see-
[John Cunningham:]
You said a massive man?
[XXXTENTACION:]
Sorry, I'm sorry, not a masked man, a hooded man and you can-, you don't see his face, it just shows the hood and he has on like, a cloak, and he speaks to me and he says "They do not understand you. Do you not fear? The worst enemy is yourself and yet you seem unbothered. Although you cannot pretend like you have walked through life unscathed." And I'm gonna have him like-, I'm gonna come up with like, his dialog and come up with something crazy for him to say, and then it'll be like me within my own mind, little do they realize like, this is all like, my world, right? So it's like, I'm gonna come up with like, this whole concept of like amounting to the light that I can become, and like understand-, like, bro, the con-, the concept can be like genius
So-
And then we can jump-, then we can like jump into the scene where I could say-, where as like-, 'cause then obviously it's like "Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go" and then like-, you can tie those line-, you can tie those lyrics on to like, someone that's a let-, afraid to let go of my previous self in fear that the fact of who I will truly become
[John Cunningham:] Letting go of someone else, you said?
[XXXTENTACION:]
Letting go of my previous self, you get what I mean?
[John Cunningham:] Yeah
[XXXTENTACION:]
Because that my-, my previous self holds like, my memories hold me to the person that I was, you understand?
[John Cunningham:] Yeah
[XXXTENTACION:]
So in the same aspect, like "Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go", you see how you can tie those line-, that tie-, that tie to that concept, what do you feel that's it's missing? Because if-, if it's missing anything 'cause obviously tomorrow is Friday and Saturday is very soon, um, oh-ho, Rufus is so fucking cute, bruh
[John Cunningham:] Literally a little leopard
[XXXTENTACION:]
However, I do feel that there is things missing and I'm gonna have to come up with something for that and then prob'
[John Cunningham:] So what you wanna do? Go to bed right now?
[XXXTENTACION:]
No, I'm not going to bed, I'd would like to go sit in front of my computer so I can remember exactly what I'm doing
[John Cunningham:]
Do you wanna go write it down or something?
Yes
Then go, go do it, are we done, should I-, should I dip?
[XXXTENTACION:]
Yes, yes-, no, you don't have to dip, I mean-
I mean if you wanna dip, yeah, then you probably
[John Cunningham:]
I mean, what, what else, do you think you gonna come up with anything else that's worth me staying around for?
[XXXTENTACION:] Shit, I mean, not-nothing that I can't send to you
[John Cunningham:] Alright


Hello, you've come here in search of release, huh? Feeling the need to inspire your soul? Wanting to disappear to a place you could feel outside of your skin? Well, you've found one: a place within my mind.

Oh, oh, don't break my heart
Bmun os m'I, emas eht leef t'nod I dna
Yeah
No dloh ot tsuj niap 'nileef eb ll'I, niap 'nileef eb ll'I

Listen close, what is this?
Is it heart break?
Is it truly what it feels like?
What it sound like?
What is truly at the essence?
Sharp teeth in the chest
Cancer all in the breast
Of the beaten and bruised
Feeling like a pawn to the greed of these fools
But I never been a piece of the evil
In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowing through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry

I guess I'm at a loss for words
To feel so close to someone, and for them to be gone the next day
I guess you never realize how permanently damaging that is


I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me
I, I was lost

So I took a different path, in the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessing his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessing he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost

I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told my self it'd get better, no clue what there was next to me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me
I, I was lost

And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming
He told me "kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, "how far are you from home?"
I said, "maybe 30 minutes"
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image
I should've run right fucking there, I-

You ever woke up on a train track
With no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Trying to scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody coming, so you scream on
And scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you?
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time is finally up


I was like oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Won't look back on my mind
Won't let bad out my shine
Won't let you cloud my mind
Won't let you cloud my mind
All my days, I was crying
All my lows, all my highs
Told my Mom, "I'm gon' shine"
Told my love, "I'm gon'-"

And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

And I was like
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-oh-oh


Yeah

Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now

I might be insane, yeah
But I love the pain, yeah
Feel it in the brain, yeah, oh
Realize she just want me hit it right
'Cause I get 'em goin' right

Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Shawty, heard you bad... word? So profane
Something like a bad, word, want your love
Call me when you can, girl
Goin' up, goin' down, in and out, turn around
Love you the way you movin' now


Ahem
Yeah

I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky
Screaming words with no remorse
Pitchforks pointed at my heart
I was staring at the sky

We're gonna break!
We're gonna break!
We're gonna break!
We're gonna break!

I was staring at the sky
Singin' toxic lullabies
I was starin' at the sky


[Kanye West:]
So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down, stoney, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don’t negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in 'Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwing rocks at your grave
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out at a rave
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it
All the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man
So I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin'
No more lames is hangin'
No more fame in famous
Ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman’s terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

Members Only. Mad it’s been a whole four months without you. I’ve been in the worst pain in my life. It's been so crazy, some-, sometimes I forget how to eat, or sleep, how to even function right. I miss, it's so weird not calling you everyday, making sure you’re okay. Sometimes we’d talk for hours, sometimes we’d talk for minutes, talk about all types of things. Sometimes we’d joke around, sometimes talk about deep conversations. To being at your house every weekend for six months straight playing League with Illie, Rico, and Leo, to being on ice and will, to riding out on, on the road, and just talking about life and have so many ideas just bouncin' back to each other. Listening to the new, listening to the albums, to the music. You taught me so much these last few years. You taught me how to be a man, how to assert control. Taught me how, how to deal with certain things didn't need to be dealt with, how to block out the negativity, all that energy I didn't need. I could go on and on for all, for all the memories we had, but damn. Think I've shared so much, it's like every time we got off the phone, the last time, the last time we talked, the last thing you said was, "I love you." I love you, Jah. Thank you for everything.

Baby, you're the one
Baby, you're the one for me


[Killstation:]
The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand

There's still a part of me
I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be
The only one alone inside your head
There's still a part of me
I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be
The only one alone

The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand
The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand

[XXXTENTACION:]
Drowin' in all of my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend
Drowin' in all of my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend

[Killstation:]
Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend
Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend

The wind blows, through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone, in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand


Hey

Spend time waitin' for you
You know I adore for you
Realized, long before you
You know I tried with you, know it
Real love, know I saw you
Said you can't hide beneath your
Pain, I seen it with my eyes

Duh, duh-duh, duh, duh

Pain, I seen it with my eyes


[Noah Cyrus:]
I thought you got all you came for
Lover, lover
Kicking up doubt when it's sore
It's going to be covered in dark
You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

[XXXTENTACION & (Noah Cyrus):]
(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my myself
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

[XXXTENTACION (Noah Cyrus):]
(Oh)
Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you
(Oh)
But I need you, and I love you more
Every minute
(Oh)
In January, and December, I want you
(Oh)
You're my ecstasy

[Noah Cyrus & (XXXTENTACION):]
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Oh)
Sifting up a reason from the lonely dirt (Woah, woah, woah)
When it's over, you'll be golden (Woah, woah, woah)
Over, over (Over, over, over)
Shut it down, going to take you outside (Woah, woah, woah)
Sucking up the dust from your static crown (Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God)
Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)
Over, over (Woah, What? What?)

[Noah Cyrus:]
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Is it gonna be right this time?
Is it gonna be golden?
Is it gonna be right this time? (Right, right, right, oh)

[XXXTENTACION:]
To the drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it
I'm a common case of a ganja blaze
And my mind is fading quite frankly (Oh)
It's a tricky course, never that way
Give my mind a question
What kind of sorcery is this?
Dark night and the ninety clips

Lacy, Lacy, Lacy
One more request
Release my pain (Ha)

[Noah Cyrus:]
Did you think you got all that you came for?
Lover, lover
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
I think you got all you came for
But do you want more?
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia
Easy is the way you free fall
Into the lap of inertia

Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone
Easy is overdone, overdone

[XXXTENTACION:]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just a man who murdered many in sake of himself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf

[Joey Bada$$:]
Slow dancing with the devil and in a burnin' room
Two steppin' ahead, until they lock me in a tomb
Been doomed since they pulled us out the womb
Satan preyin' on me, she be throwin' souls inside the wombs
Life shoulda eat you up, spit you out, beat you up
But bitch, the door don't stay enough, don't think I see enough
Baby, I see too much, baby, I can't call it
I need my soul in these bars like a alcoholic
I can't trust nobody, I put that on mind, soul, and my whole body
I see demons and there's nothin' they don't know 'bout me
No matter I try to hide, they gon' find me
So now I never run from it, 'cause I come from it
I never lied, Devil's eyes in the beast's stomach
I look the Devil in the eyes, I could see she bluffin'
I pull the red dress to the side, tell her keep comin', keep comin'

[Kemba:]
I just found out family and enemies could be different
I was steppin' over syringes that's in my kitchen
After momma died, I couldn't go to the bathroom
Without gettin' some second-hand Hell with how I'm pissin'
This is just me paintin' a picture of what I live with
What you know about comin' home to your shit missin'?
And findin' out the niggas that helped you look for it had did it?
This is just me paintin' addiction
These niggas took methamphetamine, ketamine, edibles, and a bean
Niggas stole my denim jeans, them the thieves, DVDs, literally anything
Food I bought anything from the vending machine
Credit card crack any door, like janitor keys
Niggas even took credit for the man I would be
And if I let 'em he would probably take twenty percent, managing fee
I'm so scared of my genes, I considered celibacy
Afraid I would ruin my seeds, like Adam and Eve
I got blood on the fuckin' leaves of my family tree
Just give me one damn minute, this shit is hard for me
I lost my whole damn momma, I lost a part of me
She lost her whole damn life from systems of poverty
Grew up with Crown fried chicken cloggin' my arteries
Increase in robberies, police and bullets that I bob and weave
It was nonstop for me, no one was stoppin' me
Either fulfill myself or be a self-fulfilling' prophecy
This just how I introduce myself, talk to me
Kemba

All I had was Ramen noodles and a little iced tea
Now my life's like a movie, motherfuckin' Spike Lee
I just want canaries on my wristwatch, yeah
Niggas get buried in the slipknot, woah
Shorty think I'm married, but my dick's not, uh
I ain't get married 'til my dick drop, yeah
I just wanna hit it in some flip flops, woah
I don't want kids, I don't lip-lock, no
If you want love, better kick rocks, yeah
I'm a rock star, ho, Kid Rock, yeah

[XXXTENTACION:]
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh
Shorty ride dick like a porn star, huh
I'm a soul eater like Black Star, huh

Diamonds in my teeth, talk ain't cheap
Waka-waka, ayy, ayy, ayy, hypebeast
What a nigga say? Hey, wanna fight, B?
Audemar, huh, on God, huh
Take it off, huh, get in car, huh

What are you doing out in the middle of this field leaving your car?
I'm just not sure what he's thinking
He's getting back into his car, he's grabbed his bag
And from our vantage there's no one around him
You know, you wait for these things to end
But then you figure out it might wind up
He's completely alone
This is really starting to worry me, I gotta tell ya
I gotta tell ya

I been speakin' to the reaper, seein' spirits when I'm sleepin'
I been creepin' with them demons, shadows walkin' the flames
Sippin' blood with the leeches
Fuck the God, you will leave him
When I look in the mirror, all I see is disgrace
All of this rage, feelin' my face
There's mud at the end of my blade
Can't complain, everything okay
Scars on my heart, from feelin' this pain
I got a knife in my back, can't kill me though
Known to be dull, my feelin's froze
Pray to the sky, Lord, give me hope
Bitch, I'm born alone and die alone
Kept hoes in my halo, slave for the peso
Middle finger, fuck that
Land of the free, feed cans to the teens
Never trust police, bitch, I bust back
Fuck the government, never trust that
All the people wanna know where the love's at
We already know where the fuckin' drugs at
Where the guns at, get your scope, blatt

Yeah, hey, hey
I was in my house with some glass shards breaking out the backdoor (Yeah)
I'ma bash your track, oh, and I broke her backbone
Wild, heard her dad call
Pushed me on the damn floor, told me, "Put my pants on"
I was thinkin' a lot of things, by any means
I'll kill this bitch nigga if he try to take the fucking girl of my dreams
I'll kill first, put his ass in the dirt
Body bag 'cause he knows where trouble at
Earth, and he ran through first


It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain
It just keeps me wonderin', this goddamn silence
It just keeps me goin' insane
Numb the pain like I was on Novocaine
Numb the pain, pain

Oh, oh

[Blink-182:]
Now I'm just a ghost in my own life
So make the most of this goodbye
Do you still dream about me late at night?
Or are you out there livin' better times?
You know it's killin' me to let go
I see your face but it's someone I don't know
Everything was perfect just an hour ago
Will you remember me tomorrow?

[XXXTENTACION:]
And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
And I won't let it control me

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turnin' around
I won't let it control me
Oh, I won't let it control me

Okay, so it's recording, it's recording now.
It's 8: 31 AM and I am currently talking to my laptop and I don't exactly know how to have a conversation with my laptop while I'm by myself
So this is gonna be, um how do you call it, a try?
Um, so here we go.
So I'm pretty sure we have a lot of SoundCloud fans that actually don't have a Twitter, Tumblr, or an Instagram or anything such as that.
Cause I'm sure that a lot of you just discovered my music through SoundCloud and probably don't know how to get in contact with me.
So here's how we're gonna, here's how we're gonna keep in contact for those of you that actually, like diehard fans.
Cause I'm pretty sure a lot of our diehard fans don't have the main social networks.
So what I want you guys to do is either download Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even Snapchat.
And I'm gonna give you each of my names and I'm gonna put em in the, in the description and I'm gonna put my partners' names and I'm gonna, like different, different people that I'm working with
Or whatever you guys want from me.
I'm gonna start answering questions through Tumblr so if you wanna get in contact with me to have a conversation, you're gonna contact me through Tumblr.
If you want to, I mean just look at what the fuck I'm thinking and have a comment on what I'm thinking, that would usually be on Twitter.
Um, Instagram obviously is just, just photos
I mean the extent to it's just a DM, I see pretty much where I check is the DM's is why I go on Instagram. So if you wanna get in contact with me, again, Instagram.
My, I'll give you contact to my manager so that way you can contact my managers easier if you have a line of business that you want to contact me for. Please only contact if it is for business.
What, I mean as far as the shows we have, what's the shows we have coming up?
We have one in West Palm, West Palm Beach on Friday with Wifisfuneral.
And then I have a, I have a show with my partner the day after and also with my partner Pollari, Kevin Pollari.
I mean if you wanna come to those shows, those are the dates.
Friday, West Palm Beach, myself and Wifisfuneral.
And Saturday, I'll be attending my partner's show in, what is it, Miami?
Well, so yeah it's in Wynwood, Miami.
So what I need you guys to do is go on our social networks and follow us.
So for Twitter, my social network name would be what my artist name is on SoundCloud.
X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N
For, I'll give you Instagram, for Instagram: heroinfather, H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
For Snapchat, theheroinfather, T-H-E-H-E-R-O-I-N-F-A-T-H-E-R
Tumblr, xxxtentacion.tumblr.com, so X-X-X-T-E-N-T-A-C-I-O-N, dot tumblr, T-U-M-B-L-R, dot com.
And, um, I'm pretty sure that'd be it.
Alright, well, on a different note, here's what I'll cover. We'll call it "a helping hand."
Damn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.
For those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?
A little bit not in tune with what's going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like you're just following whatever is right in front of you
Here's what I call a helping hand, here's how I'll help you do it:
With whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.
So say for instance you see money in your life and that's what you want more of.
The more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.
The more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.
People think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.
Or these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but it's literally what it is.
So, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.
The more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.
And that, there's no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like you've been thrown into some sort of disarray.
[*glitch*]
Woah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didn't pause.
Yeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.
Whatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?
What you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.
So if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.
There's no simpler way-holy shit.
Shouts out to Teflon Sean.
You need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.
But yeah, also, study the Golden Beetle.
With that being said, goodbye.


I dream so much and I just can't seem to find an answer for what I'm living for in general
I can't keep living like this, its breaking my heart day by day
I mean who's to say you find an answer when there isnt?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a dream?
What if we live for no reason?
What if we just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life?
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplation
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please save me


There was blood in my tears
I heard so many complaints to remember
I will never change
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Break!
Yeah (she said, she said)
Yeah

If the seasons change
Will you remain the same?
Oh, how I love the cold
Because of you I'll never know
Gold teeth in a flask (yeah)
Many men without a soul
But the fall is all we know, yeah it's all we know
I look forward to the ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Break
I will never change, I will never break, yeah
Break, yeah

Many men are of a dying breed.
Plunge the knife into his throat and suck the blood of human out it's case, dangerous.

I observe the father, walk into an alley,
Probably go in just to take a piss.
Slowly, surely, I will take position,
Without hesitation, I will grab his wrists. (yeah)
Chop him, buck him, fuck him,
I will stab him, splat him, drag his body all across the map.
Shower in his fluids,
Kiss him, bite him, eat him.
Threw a fit, and then I take a nap

Butterflies,
Kidney stones,
Slit wrists
Vagabond.
Concubine,
I'm alone,
Very holy when I'm not alone.

Different person when she texting, guess her heart was hurting
She need attention I'm guessing I didn't get the message
She told me "Bae, I know you miss me, why you still pretending?"
Louie loafers, Fendi, and different colors matching
She leave her house like she winning a fucking beauty pageant
And when she older, she told me she wanted to be an actress

Lost friend feelin' shitty, called pissy sissy
Broad feelin' like death or when I'm ready

Bullets like I'm fetty
Ax to the brain
Drugs for the pain
How you feel the same ma?
But they'll never ask for the pain
Ask for a slit
Knot then we hang

Make her pussy trod
Razorblade upon the skin
With every sin
We could reminisce
We were fuckin' pissed
Now I'm in this shit
Pissed as a bitch

Hip-hop's a jungle, nah

You see my raps became subordinate
Posting portraits of flow and gin
More the note of the porridge
Than more anointed than ordain
More annoyed than an orphan
From Corbin who's often orphanos
And snorting some block detergent, merging for common purpose
They notice that I was soaking in lotion
Running the motion, devotion was not a notion
Hoping that Lexi's open for fucking
Fuck it I'm ducking, and trucking off to New Zealand
I'm wheeling, dealing, cartwheeling
Pop pill and feeling like villain
Haha

Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go
So in my grave I'll rot

Alright, I found this sound in Stockholm
The comfortin' I feel with it
It's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel it?

So if I escape
Will my pain go away?
This thing should be needless to say
I walk in my mind and I wonder
But till death the inferno, I plunder
Action misleading the spared
There is a home, but with nobody there
In debt with the darkness for years and the centuries
A body is hidden, so you ought to envy
Your actions are covered in sin
But you've never felt so alive
If you think that you're leaving, you're wrong
You've not a choice but to die

Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep (Now, ayy)
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep (Ayy, ayy)
Envy this, so to speak, no despair, go to sleep
There is no escape (Envy this)
There is no escape
There is no escape

I found this sound in Stockholm
So comfortin'
I feel, I feel as if it's a form of hypnotism
Do you feel this?


As a fair warning to everyone listening to this song
I advise you to not hide your feelings
Don't pretend to be okay when you're not okay
Don't pretend to be happy when you're sad
It'll only lead to your misery

Don't you fucking hate it when you hear my name?
I feel the same and when you hear this you gon' feel the pain
And all these niggas that you fuckin' with to get away
But girl I know you think about it almost everyday
And I'll be honest I be jealous of these niggas, true
How you feelin' with these niggas that you talk to?
Captivated by your mind and your walk too
Can't replace you with these bitches that I talk to
They say "lust is love" we had trust, what's good?
I should've held you close
Should've kept you warm
And when the rain is fallin', wonder who you call
Don't pray to god, you rather drive your car
Don't talk
Pretend it don't hurt
Repent, I won't stomp, my feet in a rage
My nigga I'm no chump
This issue when I crave you, hate you
You think I'd rip the wings off of my fuckin' angel
It don't hurt, damn

It'll be alright soon
I'll forever be the, I'll forever be the elephant in the room
I'll always love you, I'm sorry

["News"]

Alright, I'm coming up
Any nigga that doubted me, I'm coming up
Any hctib that looked down on me, I'm coming up
I stand out, I do my tihs
I'm always been on my tihs
I do this for my mom, I do this for my brother, I do this for my fam
I'll kcuf anybody that says otherwise, case closed, my nigga

Mmh

Eh ya, mmh, eh
So this how the story go
Ow, eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem rising
Rising, rising
Eh eh
Den gon dem fallin', fallin', fallin'

He showin' signs of corruption
Then went from somethin' to nothin'
He put his hands on his mother
And now he's fuckin' his cousin
Now she's havin' his baby
The bitch is driving him crazy
The motherfucker was violent
'Cause he was fresh out the Navy
She dealt with constant abuse
Never revealing the truth
She kept the feelings concealed
Until they rose to the roof
A war starts, heart drop, 'cause she was tied to the bed
She said she thought it was over, he put a gun to her head
But listen

All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I d-i-e, all you niggas just p-i-e
Nah nigga can't sleep on me, ah ah
But listen
All my life, I dreamed these things
Seems surreal that I see these things
Until I d-i-e, all you niggas just p-i-e
Nah nigga can't sleep on me

Sleep with a knife by your bed
So convinced she got a gun to her head
Only relief is when she's taking the meds
Or taking Henny instead
Taking liquor to her belly in bed
Until her belly is red
Now she's findin' out the baby is dead
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she got no cure
And she want more
She don't wanna live this life no more
But she's stuck because she's got no cure
And she want more

Eh eh
Jah, Jah yutes dem rising
Rising, rising
Eh eh
Den gon dem fallin', fallin', fallin'

About a quarter to noon
He started roaming these streets
Left her tied back home
Her mouth was covered with sheets
He started making observations from starting the conversations
Pill pop, left himself with no options
'Cause his mind is made and he keeps counting his days
Rather than smoking, the nigga simply going insane
Tied himself to the bridge as it began to occur
Fuck, I couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur
Guess it's the drugs that made the nigga absurd
Thin-thin-thinking 'bout the past and all the things that he learned
But then it came to a turn
Started thinking evil thoughts in the burn
Ran for years and now the thought has retur—

["Flock"]

Pussy popper
Young Waka Flocka

Get your mind right, only way a nigga coolin' if I get high, right?

Skinny motherfucker, won't you tell me where the cash at?

They say "X is just a city bitch", ya feel me
But it's not really gon' be that bad

Rap rigorous
Ace the plate, kill this shit
Pace is great, villainous
Filling the plate
Pissing all over you pussy pedestals
Skeptical, little edibles
Spread 'em, and I'ma wet em
Forget 'em, I'll never let 'em, reread 'em
No scope, they scatter
Coke flow, like batter
But drain like batteries
All you niggas is calories
Get burned, this finger, your bitch squirm
You're bigger, as just learned
Your nigga should take turns
I pop that pussy like an adderall
Niggas will act as if they powerful
But got they backs against the wall
And ever the flick of my niggas the bigger my niggas
And pass the stretcher
Part of the reason I fuck this all up in this second and pass the pitcher
Mr. Mr. get ya coke slang like Mrs.
Like Mike Vick, I'm vicious and misfit
Don't fit like fitness, my wrist
This on fleek shit, my wrist on slit bitch
My dick my dick met
Shit like ass-crack
Piss my slit with' slow to fight back
Niggas in Chiraq, shooting like Iraq
Death to Jah's soldiers, bust your kneecaps
I came to murder you niggas, no need to fight back
No need to fight back
No need to fight back, yeah


[XXXTENTACION:]
Pick litter the middle of six niggas is bitter
As dick lickers as licking the cliques clitoris
Vigorous black bags and the vividus black casper
And back the bash faster
Better, mean cash or with cassidy
And the passenger packin the shovel
Rackin up bodies, quicker than calories salaries
Mean spend it and vend it a pussy magnet and stagnant
And quick fragments of faggots
Who's clique blackin' with cactuses
And the package delivered
Fuckin' synonym cinnamon covered synonyms
Get' em got em'
Killin em killable fuckin liberal kidabble
Litta fucka' then suck a condom and couple looking with therapy
Office and officer
Of accomplishing condominets
Any converse is commonly
Incompetent prominence
Get a communist but-
They never understand
How it feels to be a man
How it feels to be a man, hmm

As soon as you're in let them all know who they're in the presence of

I am a murderer, I am a demon, a son of a serpent
What is your faith, what is your worth have you felt acknowledgement
If I kill you now, will you go heaven or hell you believe in
Death is approaching you
Thirty seconds, think before lying in a blood sea

Grippin that pistol grip
Yo' bitch is submissin' so I make her pistol grip
Murder and kill her jits

Cock in her mouth to show you what I'm bout
Yes I fucked her then made that bitch shoot her kids
Three heads like cerberus, geeked off adrenaline
Feelin like Shaq, I'm a dunk on the pig
He dirty like derby, she suck me like kirby
I murder the fucker then eat on her clit
I fantisize 'bout a Japanese bitch
She fantasize about sucking my dick
She wanna be famous, for shaking her anus
I told her to Kim K and fuck on the flip

I got the pistol grip
I'm down to pistol whip
Yes, I got the pistol
Yes, I got the pistol bitch

Got a 40 Glock and that drum niggas
So when I shoot the shit they go aye

Burn the fucker
Never yearned the fucker
I'ma leave the body in Dubai
Aye


I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
Your pussy was there for me, was there for me
You know what you did to me, you did to me
I'm having withdrawals, withdrawals, withdrawals
But you don't know what you stand for me, you done to me
That pussy was ecstasy, was ecstasy
You said I'm the chosen one
Your only one
I know I was wrong
Fuck, but that pussy was ecstasy, ecstasy
I want you right under me
Te amo mami
You were the one for me, the one for me
I know I did wrong, so wrong, wrong
I'll fuck you thread around everything, on everything
You knew you were everything, everything
I'll fuck with everything, everything


Luke White on the beat!

You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice"
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views" and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—

We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings
We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!
We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!
You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America, the niggers are taking it over and the Jews
Make a stand, join the klan
White power! White power! White power!
And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!
I hate them because they breathe!
I hate them because they're scum!
The goddamn niggers are the scum of the earth!
White power!


Yeah, I'm a creative genius
And there's no other way to word it
I know you're not supposed to say that
About yourself and I say things the wrong
Way a lot of times but my intention,
Is always positive
"You're... you're a genius, you really are... you're a genius"
I know

Black ski, gold teeth
Gold teeth, fingerless,
Blasphemous, wrists are slit,
I kissed the bitch,
Blood on my lips,
Holy shit, he scared the bitch,
I grabbed her bra and tell her she can,
She can... she can...

Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Run my, run my, run my head
Oh no...
Error

Kill a fuck nigga make em' write what they know

Very Rare savage make a fuck nigga bleed

Sever the mind
Wonder what you'll find within the souls divine
Put 'em on ice
Watch the nigga slip, think he will not suffice
Make 'em idle, all to be infamous
Time becomes a fucking rival
Basically battled the devil within himself
He faced the fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face, I hate this place
Goddamn, disgusted by my face
I feel like a waste of damn skin because the tint that's on my face


Ayye, haha, yuh

FUCK out my way, Johnny Cage face kick
I might lose my mind, I can't ever love a bitch
Face that dope, fuck a vote, fuck Trump
When that nigga win, put his body in the trunk
I eat the flesh off an enemy, liver lookin' oh so fuckin' good me, yuh, aye
Menace is the only fuckin' friend of me, aye, yuh
Fuck that shit, I need Hennessy, yuh, aye
Wave lookin' like mass genocide, aye

Fuck my life, I don't wanna live
Death before dishonor I am not a pig?

Suicide pit! Suicide pit! Suicide pit! Suicide pit!
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up, yuh
Fuck my life, fuck my life, fuck my life up! [x2]

Turn off your phone
Leave it at home so nobody can trace you
Mask your expressions
Appear to be calm, they won't read your intentions

The evolution is near
The brains will start to abandon their religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Yeah

I behead a motherfucker for his context
Take the body where the others can't see
Seen the devil in my eyes without them contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea
Yuh, narcissistic crucifixion
Dead weight, I been searching
Niggas coexist, you just don't see 'em work with other bitches
It's me, black and white, the dark of night
That's when I do my searching
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind
The evolutions lurking

The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed
The sun started falling, when you woke up
My feet weren't covered, when you started getting dressed

[xXXTENTACION:]
Forgive what's said in fear
And all I ask of you is hear
The girl with the golden heart
I killed from the inside out at dawn
The sun has only just arose
Cannot heal all the hearts that I've broke
The boy with the broken heart
His goal is to rip everything apart

[Scott James:]
Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

The oars start sinking
When you let go
To use your hands while speaking
Something I'll never let us float

Don't leave this town my dear
Don't leave here for the day
I'm on the ropes again
I need you as I am
Oh, Oh

I must have caught your cold
I could not sleep at all
I'm clinging on for hope
I need you as I'm close


Hey there you, looking for brighter season
Need to lay your burden down
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling
Buried under deeper ground

I seem depressed, always being bothered never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a cheque
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast

Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
Fear of understanding, the Devils running his course
Pitchers not receivers, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Minds full of greed exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards
Everybody is superficial, only breaching the surface
Surface, upon the Earth
Flames engulf the Earth
And prized possession they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when that heaven gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath
Try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinion then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then, cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, accurate fact put the black in fact
If you thought that, you are free, you should disregard that
All fact

Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
My hypothesis, is, death ain't shit
I'd rather die than be alive in this life

Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumblin'
Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumblin'
Hey there you, try to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumblin'
Through the sky, through-through the sky

Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own

Through the sky, through-through the sky
Through the sky, through-through the sky
Through the sky, through-through the sky


God...
Who the fuck is...
Who the fuck is...
Ay...

[XXXTENTACION:]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling it up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull
And so...
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Torture victims and duty
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so

Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men
Innocent
See, living for a reason I don't know
Fuck shit hoe

[xxxRamze:]
Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as the eagle takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down to my knees
Bow down to my knees
Fuck that
Smoke that DMT

You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends
Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it
Now let me take you back to the story, that I once told
Ay, ay, that I once told...


Fucking bitches with my Go Pro
Pida la Vida I won't go broke
All of these bitches they want hard core
Pussy you talking but won't fade I know
I need the coke I can't cope, hope
Dive in that pussy and I slow stroke
Triple the x
I might triple the cup
I might double it up
I might no scope
I might bedazzle my pistol, aye
"X you're a goon what's your issue?" Aye
Diamonds electric like Raichu, aye
If you need lean I might pint you, aye
Hollow tips all in my rifle, aye
Make your head lean like the Eiffel, aye
Said my dick look like the Eiffel, aye
You say I'm white I might fight you

Double up, aye
Double up, aye

I just got 2 bitches need to double up, aye
Double up, aye
Double up, aye
Double up, aye
Double up, aye
I just brought them bitches need a double cup, aye
I just brought 2 bitches need a double cup


And hell is just a government creation
And all the information they solicit isn't nearly close to truth
It was clear since the alteration
Of the books our children study when they said Columbus discovered America, oh, the ultimatum
Of telling you the truth but oh well I'm already in hell
I'm tired of havin' patience
So I'ma sell my soul and say some shit that fuckin' bothers you
Jesus wasn't white nor black, I can't knock it
Was somewhat a Arab and one hell of a prophet
Don't understand why J. Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets
But didn't mention higher-ups
Change your name to Amber Cole
These fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules
Sucking government dick for safety to stay cool
I'm absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers
Tie your throat to a truck bed and pedal the metal quickly


Shooting guns just like it's heroin
Deep in the pussy like a body burial
Bitch underwater, what I name her? Ariel
Cutie booty, I'ma fuck her up the uh, woo
I wanna fuck on your mouth
I wanna fuck on your daughter, your house
I wanna make that bitch pussy my spouse
She wear Giuseppe, she open her mouth

I put bricks on a bitch, thirty xans off her tits
I put molly on that bitch, I put molly on that bitch
I put bricks on a bitch, thirty xans off her tits
I put molly on that bitch, I put molly on that bitch
I put bricks on a bitch, thirty xans off her tits
I put molly on that bitch, I put molly on that bitch
I put bricks on a bitch, thirty xans off her tits
I put molly on that bitch

No, for real like stop fucking calling me

Every fucking time you call me
On Snapchat, and Face- I don't wanna hear from you no more
Alright, I'm gonna hang up on you now, okay?
Stop fucking calling me
I said I hate you, stop calling me
Lose my fucking number because I'm done
Uh, I can't yell no more
Nigga, you ain't do shit for me, I promise you

All the shit I did for you, okay
Alright, how 'bout this big shit like you gon' be something

Okay, okay, go ahead talk all that shit now
But who had your back? Me, I did


They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman
Tell me she from Colorado
And she love women
She'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin'
I'm still losing my mind
I know I been trippin'
I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dying, am I living
It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
Cause all these girls the same, love
Error

Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (Bad kidneys)


Ooh, ooh
Like oh-woah

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh

Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my dorm, I see her face in my room
When im along in the room I'ma blame that on the shrooms
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh


[laughing]
Hello? Oh my god!

Oouuff, ooh my god
Yeah, yeah its cool [laughing]
Hello? What in the fuck did I tell you about calling me?
You found out about who?
Yeah, I bet you did found out about him too
Yeah, I fuck with him, I fuck with him for real [laughing]
Oh, you mad now?
Nigga you ain't mad about shit [indistinct laughing] (Girl pour me another one)
Okay whatever [laughing]
I'll talk to you later okay
Nah, nah I ain't even gone talk to you later
Don't- Like I said, delete my number!
Why are the fuck is you still calling me
Why are you pressed about me fucking on him?


I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)

I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

I've been through the ringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no I ain't a cheater
She hate me when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out her shirt
I'll take her to the cleaner
Love don't end girl if it means no good for me
She's good for me
Too good
These hoes love playing me
Heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me
Just bring me drugs

Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

I told her run around and get away
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout
I need to set another play
I need an umbrella cause every day feels like a rainy day
I need something other than xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California
I'm tryna cut corners
Say they bossing me around
But you know I don't take orders
I had to move around, I was starting to feel cornered
I can't see the front door
Starting to feel cornered
Starting to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screaming out "why bother"
My ex-bitch too bad
My next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash
She ride it like full throttle

I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or because I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first


Ooh, ooh, woah
I never been scared
I tell you that I don't care
Really I do care
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)
I never been scared to love (Drop dat bomboclat!)

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
So I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked up
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell, you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way

I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love, just scared of love
Not enough, I'm not enough
You're way too much and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough

Okay, it's me again (I've called you, like 30 times now! Why can't you answer the phone now?)
And no I have called you back a billion times
Why can't you answer the phone?
What-(yeah!) I know I'm sorry
I told you, that none of that meant nothing to me!
Noth- Nothing meant nothing to me! (I gave you everything!)
He didn't mean anything to me
I told you I was there for you
So you just gone give everything I gave you, to someone else?
You just gone give me all away like that?
Nigga, you was just calling me! (Yeah you was the one saying all that, but I don't care! I love you! I have always loved you!)

God, oh god Waynes
Now we cookin' up (yeah)
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup in her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm mournin' so they textin' me
Ex bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story that's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing
Devil trying to test me, I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts baby looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep I been feeling like a night owl
Music turned up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me so it get lonely at night now

I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long, gone

Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup in her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think of the days when I used to undress her


This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, just always
Just faded 'cause I never throw up
Pray to God my plug can pour up
Pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time we tried to rob 'em
He lucky, bro, lil mane fucking off him
I'm drinkin', drivin' in the Bentley coupe so
It's hard for me to drive, move too slow
Told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, anti-hero
I burn my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
I really got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door

This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over

This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma

I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moonrock on me, I love the auroma
Get so high that I'm in the clouds with falling angels
These missles halos
She love the coke but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a rollercoaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In the coffin, laying stiff like a board

This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the road, the end of the road
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over

So

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking off-white, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time
Molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't give respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine

I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine
But in the meantime
Bitch, it's lean time
Bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time
'Cause it ain't killing me
My Lil bro keep a 40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money, Don't worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime
Bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time
Outta energy
My momma told me "stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me
I'ma be fine

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night

I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold up bro wait, I'ma be fine

They know my name, oh wait
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties
I've got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating ramen, with a Glock nine
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she's calling me her next guy

I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night

Hey I woke up leaning

Hey!

I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Day trip took it to ten

I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

What's the 27 Club? Uh, uh, uh, oh
We ain't making it past 21
I been going through paranoia
So I always gotta keep a gun
Damn, that's the world we live in now
Yeah, hold on, just hear me out
They tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out
What the fuck is this 'bout?

I'm tryna make it out
I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out
I'm tryna take the girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends too
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
That hit's for you

I usually have an answer to the question

Daytrip took it to ten
Fine, fine

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

I know I have a purpose, but I don't see the purpose
They tell me the death of me gon' be the perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal and death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing little bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first
Yeah, gotta have some crude humor
Just to keep a good vibe going, keep the song grooving
So all my money longer, shout out bro Uzi
Keep my eyes in the sky 'cause that's where I'm moving

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind

This is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
I know how it feels, you don't wanna struggle anymore
Used to ball hard, ain't no triple-doubles anymore
Bitch, I'm talking 'bout my tears
Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here
R.I.P. to all my peers
Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear
But I still hear the fallen ones in my ears
Why, why do we live to die, die?
When it's my time, time, time
I'll leave behind my end, my 13 Reasons Why

Say they wanna read my mind
They really wanna read my mind
Telling you right now, all you'll find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind
They say they wanna read my mind
Do you really wanna read my mind?
I promise, all that you will find
Is a lost soul, rich and blind

Is a lost soul, rich and blind
Blind, blind, blind


From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos

Oh, yeah, I'm keepin' it real, real
I'm keepin' it real
Oh, yeah, life gets tough, shit is getting real
Yeah, I don't know how to feel
Swallowing all these pills
Not my real feels

Uh, devil standing here tryna make a deal, uh
It ain't no deal, feel like I'm goin' crazy but still it took a lot to get me here
Losing my sanity up in the house on the hills, hills, hills
I didn't have vanity then and I still don't have vanity still, still, still

Bein' me, I rock PnB
These hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ these drugs
Actin' like mosh pits, squishin' me, oh my
Oh me, how they kill me slowly

Lonely, I've been gettin' no peace
OD, feel like overdosing
Low key I have been looking for signs
But all I can find is the sign of the times

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos

I ain't suicidal
Only thing that's suicide is suicide doors
Fight for survival
Gotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up
Hold my hand, through hell we go
Don't look back, it ain't the past no more
Gonna get to them racks on them niggas, whoa-whoa
Yeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls
Exhale depression as the wind blows
These are the laws of living in vogue
We're perfectly imperfect children
Rose from the dust, all of us are on a mission

Never gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now we live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'
I don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches
Now I live it up, drivin' with the rooftop missin'

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm comin' back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawl space, this a dark place I roam

Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem solve with styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul
I'm empty, I feel so God damn empty
I may go rogue, don't tempt me
Big bullet holes, tote semi autos


Stuck in a maze, oh oh oh oh

They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this
I took my demons into the bank of life 
And I made the biggest deposit 
Without drugs I'm losin' my logic 
These pills are my Pro Tools, still got Logic
I run, I run, I run
I run, I run, I run

Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay
But it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm goin' insane, life's not the same

Numb the pain, take these Perc's in the mouth and the nose

All the drugs I did, they weren't worth it
Now I'm worthless
I hope my new lady thinks I'm perfect, oh
Sometimes I feel like that she'll be better off
Without me, but without her I would die, oh
I would die, oh

She know me well, well, well
She know me well
Told me she loves me still
Bitch, go to hell
All the drugs I did, it was worth it
Super worth it
Uh, tell me why you had me feelin' worthless?
Now your heart broken, you need a surgeon
Yeah, I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain
Yeah, I know one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain
Yeah, yeah, yeah


I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today

Race
Ring ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong

All day today, same thoughts
This is all the Devil's fault
I ain't mean to name-drop
Often I'll pop all three
I'm off all three
Should I make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Somethin' ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought 'em
Somethin' ain't right with my mind, so I lost it

Drugs turn my knob, then I run like some faucets
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high
It's exhaustin'
I was told it gets better in time

Ring, ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well, no
Go to Hell
"Oh pretty please
Get me these"
"Buy me this"
"Buy me that"
Bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress
I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am high on drugs
And low on sleep?
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high
It's exhausting
I was told it gets better in time

I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real
Or where I belong

Ruinin' careers, man, this shit easy 
What my nigga Davis say "This shit beyond me"

Yo, okay, I'm back in

Uh, I wanna try, but I

Uh, acidic, a bunch of bad habits with bad magic
I can't disappear and re-appear in the same sentence, I'm bad at it
The Mad Hatter, the pump-packer, the mob thrasher
The purp mixed with the syrup turn me into a contractor
I straight freak, so high I can't speak
Been three weeks, I still haven't met my peak

Like I could be someone other than myself
Like I could find a little heaven up in my hell
Yeah, I know it never, ever end well
Yeah, I know I always fall victim to a wish spell, uh
Like abracadabra
The flow so raw, forgot to grab magnums
Been raw-dogging bitches ever since I went platinum
I feel like hell full of bad bitches
Wonder if there's room in heaven for savages
My life's a canvas, I'm painting in blood like a cannibal
Rip off his head and I salvage it
Huh, a little too graphic
At least you niggas know that I still got the passion
As someone who ain't got shit but the clothes on they back
And it's been that way since way back since

Like I'm a killer or something
These niggas lip-syncing like Milli Vanilli or something
I'm like Lil Wayne, I got a Milli-Milli-Milli or something
I guess I'm rich and broke, pockets bountiful
My soul's, empty, so deep, 10 feet
Times 10 feet

Fuck love, it's gon' take more to convince me
That you with me
And not against me
Where I'm from we load it up
Pop out and turn niggas into mince meat


I'm in the studio with Nex and Lotti
Oh yeah, three musketeers
Hey baby

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
(Too close, come here)

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close so you I'll hold
Hold you by your soul
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go (Go, go, oh)

You can bury me with her and if she die before me
Kill me and carry me with her
Know if I die before her, make sure you dyin' a widow
Let's not walk down that road, forever's forever
Eternally attached to her soul
Oh, oh my God
I thank God for her smile
She's too fine, I'm too wild
When I fuck, she taps out
Let's get a house and settle down
Let's have a child, watch him runnin' around
I'm at my all-time high now
You're my sunshine through life's rainclouds

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close so you I'll hold
You by your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go (Go, go, oh)

They tell me life is a riddle,
I found the answers on her tongue in the middle of kissing
I swear to God she can't do wrong
Wonderful tripping, making brash decisions
That's what they tell me but they don't get it, can't grasp the image

Passionate, I'm past bitches, in love with a woman
She past drippy, the Gucci slippers, Versace linens
I'll take her out to dinner, she usually Hibachi grillin'
Poppin' and railin' the last of the Perkies before we kick 'em

You keep my whole, my antidote
You are my dope addicted soul
Addictive soul, that's you my love
Can't get enough, I need to feel your touch
I need to feel your touch
I can't get enough

No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close (No such thing as too close)
No such thing as too close so you I'll hold
You by your soul, I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go (Go, go, oh)


Wake up from a dream
She's my every, everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility

I can't go to sleep without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me, me

Uh, I'm trapped in my head
She has the key
She walks me to her bed
I can't wait to see the freaky things
She does to me
All her old niggas, they are under me
Back to you, baby, you're a Picasso piece
Yes, indeed
You're lovely and I can't help it
Follow me through the hell and the storm
Honestly, feel like I been here before
Probably
She's even here in my dreams
I came looking for you
'Cause I knew that you are all I need

Wake up from a dream
She's my every, everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility

I can't go to sleep without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me, me

Baby, you're the champ
Got you soakin' when I'm in it
It's way more than damp
You've got so fuckin' wet, I have to build a dam
Talk about good romance
Baby, lookie, lookie
I'ma eat you like studio cookies, oh
You ain't dealin' with a rookie
Girl, I'm fresher than the fuckin' Rockies, yo
You be in Jersey like you Snooki
But I know you really came from Philadelph'
Just like Meek Milly, oh
Got my Gucci sweats on
Tryna feel it through the pants, through the drawers
Fuck her good, she sleep it off

Wake up from a dream
She's my every, everything
I need her more than anything
She's my tranquility

I can't go to sleep without her next to me
So I'm sure she's the one for me, me


Uh, let's see if you a rider
Let's see if you a rider
(That sound clean)

Hey, let's see if you a rider for real
I don't know if you a rider for real
I'ma fight for your love, survival for real
Uh huh

Uh, let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real

I don't know, oh I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close

Let me down asleep with my casket closed
Nail it shut, make sure not to leave a thing exposed
I don't know, oh I don't know
Blonde hair don't care, please don't leave me froze

Stuffed cigarillos and Perc's keep me a hoe
Shoulda shot it in the head, words from my bro
But anything for romance, so I'ma risk it all
Oh oh

Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real

I don't know, oh I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close

I'm Codeine Cobain, I'm a I'ma pour a four
I don't do cocaine but it's Perc in my nose
I suffer from excessive road rage
Take my life and crash it into this hoe

It don't matter, you can have my heart
Kill me faster, what's mine is yours
On a platter
I watched you grab that dagger
She's a stabber
But is she a rider?
Or is she poison?
A viper?
She gets me high, a supplier
And I'm on fire
Will she be my fire-fighter?

Let's see if you a rider for real
I really wanna see if you a rider for real
Don't think just 'cause you grip the wheel
Makes you a straight-up rider for real

I don't know, oh I don't know
If I should give you the key to my soul
I don't know, no, I don't know
My paranoia and insecurities hold me close


I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless, regardless

I figured she was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch then turned herself into a target
Click clack

She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch then turned herself into a target
Just for talkin' nonsense
Claimin' she was leavin'

Not gonna happen
If I can't have you, no one can
'Cause if you leave, I'm not breathin'
Show you how first to not breathe, breathe

Inhale, exhale
You're the best, well, you're the worst
But you're the best
Hell, I ain't never, ever gonna lose, lose
Tell me what I gotta do to prove to you
Five seconds from losing my head
Now it's time I show you what a lunatics do

She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch then turned herself into a target
Just for talkin' nonsense
Claimin' she was leavin'

She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
The stupid bitch then turned herself into a target
Just for talkin' nonsense
Claimin' she was leavin'

Hate it when you tease
Where you think you're goin'?
Were you comin' back to me?
You walked in, I'm listenin' to Stan on E
Yeah, ecstasy
Matter of fact, there's a bridge that my car wants to meet
Road trip on me
It'll be fun, you'll see
But you don't gotta sit in this trunk
You can sit next to me
Me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk-drivin'
Me, I'm just straight Percules
My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
As we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make-believe

My crazy thoughts and your crazy heart
As we hit the bridge, that's just the start
Not afraid to die, as you can see
Life isn't real, love's make-believe
Error

Big ol' gun in the Fendi

Hands up, bitch this a stick up
Look up, my car like a spaceship
Smokin' cookie bought 'em by the cases
This Dior on my feet ain't no K-Swiss
My lil' niggas are demons in training
Shoot a fuck nigga in the head
Head shots, head shots, no legs
I just want some head
Burberry on the bed (Ya dig?)
It cost to live how I live
I'm tryna roll off an E
Have your little bitch swallow my kids
Off the molly feel like Lil' Bill
Lord knows I love my pills
Lord knows I love my thrills, and clothes
I got kicks like im FIFA
Cracking cards and hoes, a bad bitch on a visa
Ain't no boxing, ho, got my hand on my heater
Big ass choppa knockin'
Bullet hole in your noggin
Fuck ass nigga stop floggin

Oh-oh, yeah, woah, yeah
Murda on the beat, that's not nice

I heard if you look her in her eyes you might die
Bad bitch, probably make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I got her personified
Don't say her name in the mirror three times
Learned the hard way but that was the last time
Ended my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

I told her that her secret's safe with me
I told her that her love is all I need
Her soul, I'll keep, it helps me sleep
Helps me rest in peace
Don't know where to go, don't know where I've been
I been too high off [?]
Lord knows I don't got any other friends
I befriended the drugs again
I fell in love with the plug again
I pulled it under the rug again
I'm drowning in a cup full of mud again
Cross my heart and hope I don't give in

I heard if you look her in her eyes you might die
Bad bitch, probably make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I got her personified
Don't say her name in the mirror three times
Learned the hard way but that was the last time
Ended my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, what do I do?
This shit's so suicidal
Percocet in my vitals, oh
Bible or the rifle, that's all that I know
Codeine got a nigga mind froze
Codeine got a nigga time slowed
The devil in the red dress kills
It told me not to take the red pill
I took the red pill and the blue pill
Last night was too real

I heard if you look her in her eyes you might die
Bad bitch, probably make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I got her personified
Don't say her name in the mirror three times
Learned the hard way but that was the last time
Ended my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

You could be my lover and my drug too

I could show you what the drugs do
I could show you what the plug do
I'm waitin' this phone right now
Perc 30's, need 'em, come through
God damn, scratched myself to death
Choppa, Breaking Bad, just like crystal meth, nigga

I got harder than a nigga tryna catch a taxi cab
Call of Duty with that toolie (Huh), no lag
Gotta keep it on me, my lil' paranoid ass

These hoes are the same

[Juice WRLD:]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

[Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty:]
Hey, these girls are insane (Lil Boat)

[Lil Yachty:]
Shoutout Megan, make a nigga cum in two seconds
It was all good til' no one wanted see me with it
Janet, shawty hair from a different planet
Cool as fuck but I can't trust a soul, God damn it
Jasmine, probably taking pictures out in Aspen
High school, back in high school, she couldn't stand me
These girls are the same
That's why I fuck 'em all the same, my brother
Drop my top in the rain (skr)
No one feels my pain but my brothers
VVS my veins
Ice cold blood can't relate to no lover
Please don't go insane
Over these raggedy hoes, my brother
Hundred thousand dollars on a rain coat
Niggas steady hatin', call them Big Joe
30 karats hangin' off my pinky toe
Asking all them questions, why you wanna know?
Shawty wanted drugs so I made it snow
Walking around askin' folks where the blow (Lil Boat)

[Juice WRLD with Lil Yachty:]
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane (oh, no)
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain love
Cause all these girls the same, love

[Lil Yachty:]
The same, love
All these hoes the same, love

Her voice sounds like a stereo and it's up in my head
When she is not around it feels like I'ma turn up dead

I wish that she was here, playing in my dreads
She told me she really likes me, I hope its not a fib
I told myself I wouldn't even go through the same shit again
She runnin' runnin' through my head like a race she tryna win

Having chest pains feelin' like I'm endin'
This is real life I am not pretendin'
Cupid got a gun at my head, finna pull it

Tattoos on her face, I kiss her ink under covers

Pills full of thrills, take your stuff, run away
Rob your connection, you buff for a day
I bet you'd kill to be me for a day

Take one perc, 30 to the face
Scratch my problems away
Callin' up the gang, is it a problem today
They don't catch feelings, but they'll catch them a case
Took your bitch to Cali, you take L's in LA

Glizzy and the Goyard, [?] on my waist
Wear it around my neck so I look pretty when I spray

Hatin' niggas turn me into Bruce Banners
I ain't Megaman, but I got two cannons
Keep a few cannons
Soundin' like a drumline, nigga, Nick Cannon
Said she had fun time, cocaine dancin'
She wanna go to hell tonight, Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Monroe, I fuck on a white hoe

Wouldn't have it any other way
Wake up gettin' money every day

It's probably 'cause I get they bitches wetter anyway
It's probably 'cause I'm livin' and I'm in a lower place
They walkin' in their slums while I'm vibin' outer space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams, and when you reach them celebrate

"Yeah, yes yes."
"But they don't sell Juul pods in-in-in London that have 5% nicotine, though."
"Right."
"This has 5, y'all have, what was it? Maximum 1?"
"That's 3."
"1.7."
"It's 3? I think all y'alls have 3 though, right?"
"3 maximum. Them shits was trash."
"Shit. It's cloudy."
"Yeah. I f- I-I couldn't even do this- I remember when I couldn't even do this. I used to try and blow clouds, and I would be-"
"I-I hope I don't get fired for doing this in the studio, 'cause m-my bosses are outside."
"It's not no weed."
"I- yeah, I mean, I don't wanna get fired, I just started."
"Well, you're in America, dude."
"What-What... Was that caramel?"
"Uh?"
"That's caramel?"
"Yeah, it's nice, huh?"
"If crème brûlée Juul tasted like that, I-I would smoke crème brûlée, but crème brûlée tastes horrible."
Hit-Boy

Yeah
Okay, Hit-Boy
Are you never heard this one either?
Nope
Okay
Okay, Hit-Boy
Let's get it, Juice!
Okay, Hit-Boy, you the shit, boy
Me and you go make some songs and get rich, boy (Woo)
I just told you I've been paying my mama rent, boy (Ooh)
That's the best money that I ever spent, boy (C'mon!)
I'ma pull up in an all black Benz, boy
Sippin' codeine with my black friends, boy (Uh huh)
I'ma pull up on the facade she live boy (Hey!)
Every day you know I'm bound to get it there, boy (Yeah!)
Me and Charlie Sloth gettin' to this money all day (Okay)
Rockin' Ksubi in the mirror, yeah, I don't do the Balmains (Uh)
Knock it out the park, and we talkin' a ball game
Like I said, Barack Obama, I'm really with all change (Uh huh)
Charlie got the Vikings on his shirt, I'm like a Viking (Woof)
Fuck a bitch and leave her, guess I'm a little too triflin' (Oof; Perfect)
I'ma Mike & Ike it, I'ma Mike & Ike it
Fist up with the clip tuck, food at fightin'
Knock 'em out in one or two punches, I'm Tyson
Listen to the next project you better buy it (Mm)
It's gon' be the realest shit you heard, I ain't lyin'
It's gon' be the realest shit you heard, I ain't lyin' (Yeah!)
I'm defyin' 2012, and it's real like the Mayans
Kill every beat and I ain't even really tryin'
I'ma tell the truth, no frontin', no lyin'
I bop to survive, my flow is the hottest
The highest, the fliest
Flyer than a pilot, my gun a library and it got a silence
But I still want Santa-ty in a piece, so
So I'll do anything to kill all the violence
But back in Chicago is bustin'
Niggas really shooting guns like the shit is nothing
Killing mom's kids and children, but this shit is disgusting
We gon' need more than a talk, more than a discussion
All I know is get the cash, yeah, get the cash
Catch up, tell them niggas, "Catch up"
They gon' need some backup
Remember hittin' stains like mustard and ketchup
Now I'm 200 MPH, they won't catch us
If you can, but you can't
I'm the motherfucking champ
You ain't Triple 9, then fuck you, get the fuck out my camp
Niggas thinking that they in it
They always come and doubt until I ball like a warrior
Switch up like I'm Durant
I'm a shoot from the three, niggas can't fuck with me
Not with the fuckery
Hotter than the summer be
Niggas really think they spell it out
But I'ma spell it clearly
Like a nigga gettin' an "A" and doing a fucking spelling bee

"Ay! Juice WRLD in the building!"
"Uh huh."
"Man, you just made my day, bro."
"You just made my day, bro."
"And that in the rest of my life."
"Man, love love."
"Just to- Just to re-in-store the faith."
"Love, sir."
"Lyrics is still there, pull neck."
"Yes, sir."
"Know what I mean? I need that in my life."
"Yes, sir."
"Woo."

Good days, good days, reminisce the good days

Yeah, I hate to say it but I fell in love again

If you niggas couldn't tell, I'm never going broke again
I love poppin' Perkies, that's my baby, love the 'Xans
Had to cover up, couldn't do that single shit again
I really love her style, but I really hate her friends
They'll be hating outside the club when they can't even get in

Look at me now like Chris Brown

All the hoes on my line 'cause I'm up now, yeah
Come through when she's not around, yeah
I'm just playing, bae, you know I'm here to stay
This is real love, I ain't here to play
I need real drugs, not the fake Perks, but the real ones
I remember I was caught up in my feelings
All these women starting to look like evil villains
Baby, you a hero, you're so different
Had to put the drug talk down for a minute
Listen, this bitch got me tripping

She gon' need some drugs when I'm finished
Put that shit under the rug when I'm finished

Run a full court press on a mattress
In the strip club, throwin' dubs, she hit back flips
Yeah I feel in love with a stripper (yeah, yeah, yeah)
In the bedroom, I'ma tip her
Fuck her off a xan, and forget her
Call the club up, tell her come and get her

Sometimes life brings me to my knees
Drowns me in my misery
Cuts me deep, makes me bleed
I'm ten feet at the cemetery
Maybe it's all in my head, yeah
Maybe I just need rest, yeah
Lately, I been stressed
Tryna impress the whole world
I'm lost in a cold world

'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So everytime
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah [x2]

Will I see better days? I don't know
Bet you never seen a frown like this before
I was told to always look at things a lil different
See my demons through kaleidoscopes
Here goes some advice I found
Say it with me, scream it loud
Don't let nothing bring you down
And out, and out

'Cause every night
I convince myself it's all in my head
Maybe none of this is real life
Or maybe I'm just not feeling it yet
So everytime
I hear the voices scream inside of my head
I let 'em know if this is real life
We're on our own, so we better be friends

Oh, ah, ah [x4]

She tell me that she wanna fall in love
What is love? I don't know much
She tell me I'm infatuated with drugs
Maybe I should just slow up

Pop a Xanny, use the Perky as a cushion
That lil' bitch, I'll fuck her if she gushing

Used to a baller, now I'm balling out with no court
How a nigga balling when you don't play no sports
Brother whipping with a fork, we had no forks
Brother whipping with a spork, we had no fork
These Xans, baby these not Advil

Went from two to popping like four pills

Ball like Michael Jordan
Get so high I'm soaring

I tell her that she thinks too much
I ain't ever give no fucks

Lost
I lost, I lost
I lost, I lost

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

Welcome to my abyss
Filled with sins and trifiling
Fake friends, I hate them
Delete them all, erase them
I'm getting lost in my abyss
Trials, stipulations and suffering
Mayhem will break them
Words from the evil faces

Drugs will fade them (Away)
Pop three I face them (Away, away, away)
Welcome to my abyss (Welcome, welcome, welcome)
Pain and suffering (Welcome, welcome, welcome)

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

It's pain in those words, you can hear it when I talk
But whats a life to live if you ain't got no risk involved?
And whats a slit to make if you ain't got no wrist involved?
Mixin' pills with the liquor, fuck, I'm finna risk it all
Still a cool dude, too smoth, just like olive oil
Known to pop pills, pop niggas and pop ollies, boy
And pop wheelies, ghost ride it, my mind is enlightened
I'm highest, the highest, don't need no ghost writer
Bitch I speak for myself, but my health ain't my wealth
'Cause I'm rich in my bank, but I'm bad with myself
Bombin' like a kamikaze, I'm the shit to these hoes
I set the play, these niggas flock, they settin' picks for me, ho
I came in killin', I'm really fuckin' the industry up
These niggas shady, they really leavin' me mentally fucked
Trapped inside the abyss with a bad bitch in the front
With a blunt in my mouth and some purple codeine in the cup

Way spazzin' on they asses in all type of ways
Pop a couple Percs to take my life away
Nah, just a lighter day, just a brighter day
She doin' all the lines, she had a whiter day
Freestylin', no writers, ayy
That mean when the songs come out I get paid
No cuts, give no fucks
I show out before I even go and show up

So what? I drink Henny till I throw up
So what? It's red lean in that white cup
Pull up on 'em like beep, that's a tow truck
Choppa on me like damn, nigga, don't duck
Duck, goose when I catch 'em
Niggas askin' questions, stop throwin' hatchets
Never had a father, always been a bastard
Fuck with me I'll beat your ass, your head is in a plaster
They don't make sense like spelling rich backwards, I'm madder
Run up, that's okay your head is on a platter
Outta space off the codeine, I'm on Saturn
Niggas got it backwards, dyslexic patterns
I don't believe in you niggas, a nigga athiest
Say this I spray it, say it don't spray it
I'll spray it don't say it, presidential brain from your main, S. Pailin
Pull up on the scene, judge a nigga no bailiff
Flow go cold, shine like VVS, nigga fuck rose gold
It's like 50k inside my wardrobe
I get new bitches, these niggas fuck worn hoes
You a whore, ho, you know it, I don't gotta say it
Pull up on the scene, my choppa just like Alizé
Pop it like a bottle, I fuck on a model
I don't wanna fuck if that bitch don't plan to swallow
I told her boyfriend he could swallow all the hollows
Don't believe me, send your location I'll be there tomorrow

Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo' dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me

Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion

Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley hoe
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf

[?]
I'm a player
Got a brand new gun, it got a Major Lazer

In the Himalayas

Her boyfriend hatin' on me, got a Glock with a lazer
Ain't worried 'bout a god damn thing

I may fuck that bitch, but I won't never save her, mmm
Pussy so good, damn I had to save it, mmm
Just so my lil thot can eat her out later, mmm

Can't organize my thots, don't need no note paper
Off the dome shit, smoke creative, anyways
You late to the party, have you belated
And if you want smoke, leave you cremated anyday
Put the bullet holes, in his windshield
Even if I'm havin' a bad day, I win still
Wake up, pray to god
Even thought that I sin still
Devil weighin' on my shoulders, like an anvil
Perky got a nigga itchin' uhh, ant hill
Fuck that bitch, then put her on my ad libs
You happy fake, bitch I'm mad real
Make that choppa masturbate, like a porn film

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't breathe, I can't breathe
(Chopsquad)
999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain, with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line I talked to addiction
Huh, speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I missed them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Something feels broke need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide them
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain, with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real, if it wasn't for the pills I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
They took the wheel and then they drove me crazy
Got me reminiscing, hyperventilating
Prescriptions like a doctor, never been a patient
Never had the patience for this crazy shit

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain, with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

With the floors, made of gold
Need a safe, filled with guns
I need women, more than one
Need a rave, just to crash it

Got high then I took the wrong ride
Balling but I feel like off sides
Smoking weed just to pass time

Fell in love, and it blew up in my face, land mine

Percocet pop, the opposite of speeding
She came from heaven, opposite of demon

Disagreements got me fiending
She's unique, her uniqueness got me to the point where I can't speak
Aw, in love, fallen
She got game, Michael Jordan

She ride me like a whore and I love it
Oh oh scoring

Getting faded on the daily, run to the cash, it ain't no waiting
Taking these Percocets, they turn me like pages
I'm getting so high, like I'm going through phases
Yeah, I know these bitches crazy, still wanna have my baby
When she get me started, no I can't stop
She took my heart and put it in a lock box

For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

For your love, workin' all day, fuck a off day
You lookin' cute in your Bape shit baby, you could go Ape
All of these other bitches are Sha Nae Nae, Martin like Payne
I am in love with a beautiful lady, she's in my brain
Star you set my heart on fire, 420 blaze
Yeah, no cliche, I can't explain
I got your name, tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen Titan, got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent if she kiss me, it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me, be there in no time
She's all right, so I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave her my heart, I'm willin' to learn
And it changed my life, I'm tryna get close with the stars tonight

Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake
When you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

My life in a nutshell
This is my life in a nutshell

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal (fuck)

Back in the lost and found, I go but I'm more lost than found
I know, I feel so cold in LA like I'm sitting back at home, Chicago
They say living's harder than dying, I'm willing to gamble that
Find me unresponsive, in a hotel room, girl can you handle that
Worst case scenario, you still hear my songs on the stereo
You still hear my name on the radio
I'll live forever, forever

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal

(Oooooh, ooh, oooooh, ooooh)
Death melodies I sing, cardiac arrest knows
I hate to bring the negative vibes in the room
But that's the ugly truth
So much of my life, and time the world's consumed
I'll throw the duse, and grab the noose
Onto the next chapter, none of this matters
I been feeling helpless

This is my life in a nutshell
Heaven so far away
I'm starting to love hell
They know me for my talent, my talent
But don't know how my pain feels
These prescriptions that I feel
Never make the pain heal

You say you love me, I'm not holding your hand

Time will tell, time will tell
I can do bad all by myself
I feel too cold, and lonely
Drugs my only, only
Fuck my life up, why don't you
I don't trust, I don't want to
I found love, but drugs found me first

They told me it wouldn't hurt me
They told me not to worry
But that's what I get for talking to the pills, no benefits
They told me it wouldn't hurt me
They told me not to worry

I can do this on my own, fuck your help 
I took my heart out my chest and put it on my shelf

 Next thing you know I'm on a dinner date, straight to hell 
Funny thing is this not my first time here 
I've been here so much, I'm really startin' to like hell
 Toxic relationships got me killin' myself
 On the phone with a therapist, bitch I need me some help
 Shorty really got the key to my soul
 Shorty play me like piana maestro
 I was taught to let live and let go
 I don't trust you, they gon' shoot you, they treat me like Metro 
Cannon on my hip, like Metroid 
Cupid wanna shoot, Imma shoot back boy 
Spinnin' Bobby Brown, that's the new crack boy 
Imma play this shit like a black jack boy

Hey, Rvssian
Ain't nothin' but a-
Uh, no good woman
No good, diamond watchin' woman
Uh

She ain't nothin but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Momma told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opioids openly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah

One thing you need to know about me is
All I ever wanted was love and money, yeah
One thing you need to know about me is
This rock-star life turned me to a junkie
Another thing you need to know about me is
I'm full of addictions, this is just vindictive
Subject a lil' sensitive, maybe I should just shallow it
Went from talkin' to 'pression to money-makin' prerogative
Still a smart guy, could've got a scholarship
Sayin' fuck college, I'ma tell you how I started it
It took one phone call from G-Money, that's my dawg
Turned me from a twenty dollar nigga to millions in my drawers
This song's about all my talents and vices (Oh-oh)
Listen repeatedly, scream it, recite it (Oh-oh)
Until it piss your father off, he already pissed though (Oh-oh)
I know, 'cause his daughter on my tour givin' deep-throat (Yeah yeah yeah)
This song's about all my talents and vices (Oh-oh)
Listen repeatedly, scream it, recite it (Oh-oh)
Yo' girl give me fellatio, you should be excited (Oh-oh)

I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout drugs, the weed and the pills
I grew up on all types, I'm talkin' 'bout music and hoes, right?
And clothes, I was overly exposed
Now I'm bein' the fruits, my momma planet didn't growed

Hell yeah, I done glowed up, I done glowed up
Oxycodin got me so'ed up, gotta remain focus
And these groupie hoes bogus, everybody knows it
But they turn me to a poet, with the love commotion
Blood, sweat and tears, money partied it in Moses
Used to roam it, now it's gas, what I'm smokin'
Like I farted, hit the gas, I'm in motion
Out, departed, wrist hangin' out the window, cost yo apartment
This the brightest that my life ever been, I need diamonds all over for when it get dark again
I call my momma up and tell her the devil marchin' in
She sent me bible verses, then I got distracted by some news from a sex worker
Who am I to not text back? That's network
Who am I to lie about my life? I know the truth hurts
Who am I to say that this ain't one of my best verses?
Uh-oh, too bad

She ain't nothin but a no good, diamond watchin' woman
Only love me 'cause she see Versace on my linens
Baby I'm not God, so your sins are not forgiven
I can never lose, every day I wake up winnin'
Momma told me cut the bad hoes off with the scissors
Make 'em disappear, call me Juice WRLD wizard
Bae, I'm high off narcotics, so your name I cannot remember
Using Opioids openly, openly fuckin' up my image, yeah

No more ruining my day
No more getting in my way
No more ruining my day

Lookin' at the damn bitch like what are you on
Why you look for love, when the love is all gone (When the love is all gone)

I ain't wanna do this, but I had to
I will never love you, I just wanna smash you
I don't wanna cuddle, kick you out the crib, I'll be glad too
But first, ride my dick like a saddle (Giddy up)
Know you love it when I hit it deep, give you tummy tuck
Fuckin' till we go to sleep, and the sun is up

And I ain't even gon' lie, that bitch prettier
So I, gotta let you

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I feel your presence on my chest
Lately I ain't been the best
Maybe it's because you left
I wake up, you're layin' next to me
Man, oh, man, that's when I woke up again
It was a dream in a dream, reality ain't my friend, mmh
Man, oh, man, time to get fucked up again
I'm gettin' higher than high so reality won't set it, yeah

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head

I woke up to see your face, but I forgot that you're not there
It's kinda crazy, ain't it complicated? Love, it got me scared
The nights are slumberless
Some toss and turn and thinkin' about my life
And where I went wrong and took that left turn
It feels like I can never do right

Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head
Sleep paralysis again, I am trapped inside my bed
Evil thoughts inside my head


Listen this shit really has me thinking man
Fuck, fuck

Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Cocaine all on the counter
Remember you in love with the powder
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still xanax all on the counter
Remember I'm in love with the downers

You can stay or you can leave
I just wanna lock you out and throw away the key
I just wanna lock you out and throw away the key
I just wanna lock you out
Hold on wait a second
You've been providing me depression
You've been abusing your position
Using your words as a weapon
You got me paranoid of other women
I'm knowing you got a ploy
You on a mission, you wanna see me destroyed
Oh no, you play with me like I'm a toy
Oh no, and I can't take it anymore
So you gotta leave
Now I gotta lock you out and throw away the key
Now I gotta lock you out and throw away the key
Now I gotta lock you out

Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still cocaine all on the counter
You got me in love with the powder
Just another day without you
I can't go a day without you
Still xanax all on the counter
Remember I'm in love with the downers
Downers, downers


40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin' cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her

Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through

Your bitch is an Xbox, play her like game room
I was tweakin' off the percs, mix it with the shrooms
Now I'm into seein' shadows in my fuckin' room (lucid dreams)

Cute chocolate bitch, thats a fuckin' Reeses
Heard her nigga was talkin' shit, pull on him and crease him
Snort the molly off her tits, energy increasin'
Replenish me, prevent from finishing, when I beat, uh

Rollie on my wrist, did it for the season
Then I put a Patek on my wrist, for no fuckin' reason
Automatic in my grip, got it for a reason
If a nigga try to take my shit, imma leave him bleedin'

40 with a 30 thats a dick, no stop, pause
Talkin' all that shit and get your ass popped off
Got your bitch doin' cocaine 'till she lockjaw
Only did it once don't know how it feels, you should ask her

Life of a rockstar rap trapper
Keep me a guitar, AR, and a tractor
Only see the snakes in the grass when I ride through (hiss hiss)
Got my nine, pull up, blow it like a drive through

Don't be scared, cause I'm here
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared

Can't nobody tell you how to love
Can't nobody tell you how to live life
Can't nobody tear me from the drugs
Can't nobody tell me what it feels like
I'm not the one to give advice
Social suicide, see you on the other side
If I speak my mind, they gonna have me crucified
Gonna crucify, baby, I'm ready to die
But even if I'm gone, I'm still here, so don't fear
My lost years are hidden in her tears, inspired by her fears

Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear, don't be scared
Don't be scared, cause I'm here
Life's not fair, but I'm here so don't fear
Even though your heart may tear
Don't be scared, don't be scared, don't be scared

I don't fear no one, paranoid, going in my gut (ayy)
To be honest, I feel like the one
I feel like the one, like the chosen one
You the silver one, I'm the golden one

Cocaine overdose, she had a bunch of those
She had a bunch of those, she had a runny nose, woah

I was thinkin' we should play a game, truth or dare
Is it true that you may be a real one? No dare

I pray to God that I don't feel numb
Really gettin' tired of lookin' dumb
Breaking hearts, ain't that fun?
Especially if you are the one
I can see the devil on your tongue, tongue, tongue
It's got an illusion of the damage done
I always base my future on the past, it's wrong
Can't help it, I know it ain't healthy
Icebox as a heart, shorty got it meltin'
Cupid got the shooter, swish, swish, uh, Raymond Felton
Hope the hammer goes down, yeah, I already nailed it
Had to sink the ship here before it started sailin'
Rain comes down, then it'll get to hailin'
Smokin' heart, like loud, yeah, I inhaled it
Shot Cupid down, hit him in the belly
Got his blood all over my Burberrys

I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
My heart never been a playground, don't play there
I ain't never playin' fair, never playin' fair
My heart never been a playground, don't play there, uh

I can't take no more of the pain, baby, don't you dare
I was thinkin' we should play a game, truth or dare
Is it true that you may be a real one? No dare

[Tracy:]
Yeah, keep my heart in your Fendi purse (Fendi purse)
Diamonds are forever, rock my chains in a hearse
I hate myself but I really love her
You know we stay fly, guess we're really love-birds
It's the way you say my name, yeah, I really like that (like that)
I want this for life and I'ma die by that (die by that)
Touchin' on her like I touch my racks (racks)
Playin' with my heart, baby, don't do that
Ooh, I don't play fair, baby, I could do that too
I swear my other bitch look just as good as you
But I could never love her, I could never trust her
I could only fuck her (I could only fuck her)
I been sippin' on this red wine (red wine)
Wondering when I'll die

But I'll lie and say I'm fine
When you, put me down
So easily, I frown
But I need you in my life
Our souls are intertwined

Baby you know that you got a knife on your tongue
Cut away at everything that I bask in
Downplay my thoughts and all of my opinions
So much for being repetitive
You say the perfect things, to make me feel like
I'm not enough for you
It kinda sucks cause, I am in love with you
You make me feel so damn uncomfortable to tell you how I feel
But I want this for real
Not a faker
Kinda scared to tame my problems, you seem abrasive
Run away from all of the drama, I've been evasive
Still thinkin' bout it on a daily basis

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today, (ring, ring, ring me)

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own, freezing all night long
Can't tell what's real, or where I belong

Uh, day to day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault, I need an angel
Often, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
So many fours like the rings on my Audi

Xans with the Everclear got me seeing foggy
I wonder how something clear got me seeing foggy
Somethin' ain't right bout' the pills but I bought em'
Somethin' ain't right with my mind so I lost it

Drugs turn my knob to the right that's a faucet
But it ain't water it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of getting high it's exhaustin'
I was told it'd get better with time (ring, ring, ring me)

Uh, I don't feel like coming to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone, uh
I don't feel like coming to the phone today
I don't feel like bein' alone

I can't deal with the chills on my own, freezing all night long
Can't tell what's real, or where I belong


I wanna tell y'all a story about this girl I met
I don't know if it was in person, or if it was in one of my dreams
But she'd have been a rockstar tonight

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
I'm racing her to hell
I don't really know her
Would I know her well enough, to know?

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her hips
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar, forreal
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know

I don't really know her well but I know her
All she wanna do is live in the moment
Pick up the pills and mix up the potions
Get high, forreal, she not with the posin'
All she ever wanna do is molly in the ocean!
I met her in Hollywood and I knew she was poison
She told me take two of these and call her in the morning
I ain't been the same since, I know when you take that road
You can't go back, ooh, my heart cold and she know that too
You play your role, and I'll play my games, we could role that dice
But know, I won't lose, no, I won't lose, you could pick and choose
It don't matter what I do, I just wanna be a rockstar like you!

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell
I don't really know her
But I know well enough to know
That she loves to take chances
Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her hips
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar, forreal
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know

I don't really know her well... but I know her

In her panties, tear it up
She love all my Givenchy, she wear it up
She still running, from my love
Got the demons on me, I'm below high
And I'm done running, from the drugs
But they still running, from my gun, right
Club life, drug life, saw her in the club light
She a killer in the white shirt, that's that off white
How you finna ball on my turf, that shit offsides
She told me that if I took the right drugs, then I won't die

Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get em up

I get money in my lone time, on my own time
I just popped a perc, and called a play so I'll be fine
Don't believe in sunshine, I'm a night guy
I lied when I told her I was Mr. Nice guy
Rockstar status, in the cut, with some Molly missin'
And you know that they dirty dancin' for the dope
She said she gon' suck me up until the bitch choke
Bitch I'm Danny Phantom, with the ghost
Pull up in a Phantom, like a ghost, right
Young rich, handsome, did the most, huh
Pop it like Champaigne, she tryna have a toast, right

Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, get em up
Rockstar status, in the cut with an automatic
Give it up, it's a stick up, run it, run it up
Get your bricks up, dummy, run em up

Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I made you go get some more, more

Say she want my heart, she can't afford it
Maybe cause I'm on my way to getting on the Forbes list
Pretty Jiggy nigga, can't ignore it
Ballin' bitch, I feel like Michael Jordan
Sip Codeine, I'm snorin
Til' the mornin'
Got the heater on my hip, like global warmin'
Run up you get shot, this is a warnin'
Freddy Kruger in your dreams, I'm filled with torment
She say that she love my bitch, whatever that means
I remember her and our friends were laughin' at me
Now they tell me I can fuck, that shit so funny to me
Lost 10 thousand playin' basketball, 100 to me

Love don't love me
Bitch I know
But the drugs still love me
That's for sure
She fell in love with a junky, gettin' the dough
Fuck her one time, then show her to the door
Everything she said, I heard it all before
I see all these demons, they disguise as whores
All I know is count the money up from the floor
If the pussy good, I made you go get some more, more

The song

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

Uh, digest, digest
This lil' heart of mine, I won't let you smash it
Burn me up inside, turn me into ashes (Uh)
Why, why?
This lil' soul of mine, won't let it get intertwined (Uh)
With somebody I, always fail to realize that
They were never mine, they were never ever mine
I was just a part in her pics, they get processed
This lil' soul of mine, won't let you get control of mine (Uh)
Won't let you control my mind (Yeah), I gotta keep that mindset
This lil' soul of mine, won't let you control mine
Oh, now you wanna stay and work it out, not this time

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you

I feel the worst, but I'm still wishing you the best
Every morning woke up mad at me, reminding me of my past
It seems as though I'm only good at one thing, making you upset, uh
Treated me like a pest, then wonder why I left
I was gettin' tired of all this stressin', unable to rest
Wonderin' what type of bullshit you'll get mad at next
I ain't even wanna do it, but I had to, shit I was glad to
You was shooting at me with your words, so I stabbed you


Yeah
We're
Laying in bed
You see the
I lock eyes
Our eyes lock

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm off the percs, you don't condone it
You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love, 'til we die
Let's fuck until we slump over

Be my first, I, know that you hate to see me bleed
I don't deserve your love, I tend to fuck up everything
It feels like I'm not enough, 'nough, 'nough, 'nough
This a conversation not a love song

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I wanna know
Is it gon' be forever, or temporary?
If you leave, it'll hurt, keep the tissue ready
Got the drugs on the table, I'm ready
I put Rick on your slippers, no Cinderella
Remember when you went to the fortune teller
She told you, we need each other
Hah, what if she trippin?
I'm just kiddin'
Back to the main focus
I think that you're gorgeous
You love the way that I stroke it
Signin' my name on your neck
You used to make potions
Playin' round with Witchcraft
I wonder if you'll put that in my lean and I'll drink that

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

We met in a Twilight Zone
I fall apart when she keep me whole
We met on the West Coast
But I still see Miami in your soul

Our eyes locked, you can see the sadness
My heart stops, every time you call my name
My jaw drops
You fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck
You fell from the stars
Girl am I lost
We're down, we're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

I'm here to serve a purpose
Girl I know I ain't picture perfect
One more thing I know for certain
If you leave I'll close the curtains

Yo girl look like sprinkler system from the way I get her wetter
I’m out the jam like jelly
I’ma go hard, catch the shot like Belly
I'm the best to ever do it, have ’em leakin' body fluids
Feel like Waka Flocka "O Let's Do It" when I'm on this music
Off the dome when I’m kickin' it
Kinda like I got an impediment when I'm spittin' it
I been rippin' writtens without writing a damn thing
I'm Doin' my damn thing, I rap and I sing
I ring like bells, king
That's me, you better king me

Yo bitch too sleazy, 40 bless yous, sneezin'

Uh, breaking Bad method how I sell this meth
Retrospect, put that shit back in retrospect
Take yo specs, take yo bitch, grab her breast, tat her chest
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that again
Lord forgive me on this mic, 'cause I know I'm finna sin
Killin' him, him, and him, referencin' Eminem
All these other rappers ain't shit but thinnin' in
I don't really got time for it
They can have a penny cause I don't really have a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch
Comin' up the full court, pressed like Kobe or somethin'
Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me that's okay, that choppa on me get the Jumpman

Im'ma the best to ever do it, say that again
Off the dome, kickin' it, that's just how it is
I don't got to write shit, I see it like a psychic
Your girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah I said it and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, and get high on this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
Dude, I do that shit on purpose, suicide in that bitch
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche
We kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck yo bitch on camera and call that shit a hardcore
Hard porn, Sharper than hard poons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so they choppas actin' like brooms
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon
Pull up on the scene, that's just me
Hey, switch that shit up real quick
I may come back to that, I don't know


I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

I told her that her secret safe with me
I told her that her loveis all I need
Her soul, I'll keep it, helps me sleep
Helps me Rest In Peace
I've been to high off [?]
Lord knows I don't got any other friends
I befriended the drugs again
I fell in love with the plug again
I put it under the rug again
I'm drownin' in a cup full of mud again
Cross my heart and hope I don't give in

I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

Ooh, ooh
What do I do, this shit's so suicidal
Percocets, in my vitals
Bible of the rival, that's all I know
Codeine got a nigga mind froze
Codeine got a nigga time slow
The devil in the red dress kills
They told me not to take the red pill
I took the red pill and the blue pill
Last night was to real

I heard if you look her in her eyes, you might die
Bad bitch prolly make a grown man cry
Heartbreak bound to leave a nigga traumatized
She's my drug, I gotta personify
Don't say her name in a mere 3 times
Learn the hard way, but that was the last time
Endin' my life, committed her last crime
Thought that was her last time

All these other niggas fake like "What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate", nah
I did this all by myself so I don't need nobody's help, shit
I'm a giant, you an elf, I put yo brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through yo block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you talkin' about heaven
Well I send yo ass to hell, right next to Jezebel
You can catch 20 shells, you a fat person, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, Seinfeld
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my 40, it came from my plaster
That shit is a blessing, I leave you in the past tense
I rap to wrappin' plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outta space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon need a bouncer, we robbin' yo accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, yo bitch in my left hand
And her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it'll come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pant pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's 21 inside the clip, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler and the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man I could rap forever if I go broke Westwood I'ma trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me cause it go, oof!
Next beat, next beat, I may come back
Next part, what should I kill? Cool


I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing, love, you're my everything

It's funny when they tell me I'm a sad boy
Then why you think I'm using all the drugs for
Cracked a Benz while I'm lookin' to the Benz track, (ha)
I won't be sad no more
Somewhere down the line I'll meet a sad girl
Next thing you know she in my bed
Next thing you know she in my room
Next thing you know she in my head

Let's add a little drama to the scene
This is when I tell you that I love you when you leave
This is when you told me that I don't mean anything
Then that's where I told you that you were my everything

I had a dream you left me
I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing left if you leave
I had a dream you left I woke up scared to death
'Cause I won't have nothing, love, your my everything


Yeah, I do what I wanna
Blunts of the strong marijuana
If I die tell my Momma I'm a stoner
Do what I wanna
Always smell that aroma

All you do is stop and stare, stop and stare (Yeah, I do what I wanna)

I know that these drugs finna do me in
But I'ma do them anyway
I know I sin, sin, sin
Don't got no regrets, yes, yes
I'ma live the best, best, best
Til I lay to rest, rest, rest
Percocet keep from all my pain
Xanny umbrella
Yeah, I hate the rain
Going through the cycle yet again
Time don't stop, no, I know, not for no man

I'm too drunk to care, drunk to care
All you do is stop and stare, stop and stare
No you don't love me, yeah
No you don't love me, yeah

You just stop and stare, stop and stare

You hate me, is that right?
Better stand up and act right
I'm living in the fast life
I'ma do the dash when I pass life
You hate me, is that right?
Better stand up
Better act right

Fuck 12, they just let my bro home
Looking at this trap phone, all these unknowns
Shorty finna let me out the friend zone

Yeah, I do what I wanna
Blunts of the strong marijuana
If I die tell my Momma I'm a stunna
Do what I wanna
Always smell the aroma
Started young now I'm feeling older
I do what I wanna

I'm too drunk to care, drunk to care
All you do is stop and stare, stop and stare (Yeah, I do what I wanna)
No you don't love me, yeah
No you don't love me, yeah (Yeah, I do what I wanna)

Flossin', why they floggin', ah shit
Flossin', why they floggin', ah shit
Flossin', why they floggin', ah shit

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him

Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on?, I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acappella
I could give you want you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me, see me smoke a million (SESH)
Drunk kickin', dutch lickin', he said he can't fuck with me
Fuck this and fuck with me, I'ma take your luck with me
Bitch, what the fuck it do? TeamSESH drippin' on the 1s and the 2s
Fuck your crew and and fuck you too
Edge of the swamp, know the truck go through

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker I'll be ready for him


I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you
And when I'm dyin' I pray to a higher power next to you Is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor?
I'm feelin' naughty I wish to explore your features secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice
My only option, watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine
I'll fuckin' kill you, take you back to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find
My little angel, in your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got no where to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got 'till I'm gone
And that's a promise, unless you didn't want it then for you I'd be dishonest

I love you to the summer and back
It's not the winter, but you've frozen my heart
And got me warmin' up my liver
I would never put a knife in your back
The love I give her is kinda creepy, but fuck it
She orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone
My little mama is mad at me at the moment
Know she's such a a prima-donna
Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'


I know that it hurts sometimes, but It's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wan' see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feeling philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, will you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
Comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room


You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why

Ohhhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Noooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhhh, fuck is you talkin' bout my shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole for eternity so they can reap what they sow
Ohhhh, I don't think I can do nothing but flow
Noooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhhh, I don't know why you in love with me hoe
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fucking life (fucking life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fucking right (wrong)
In your thong smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (ay, ay)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch I'm tatted out my shirt so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed
I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm praying to the sky and I don't even know why


I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So lets laugh a little 'fore I'm gone
I've been dreaming of this shit for awhile now
Got me high now
She don't love me but she's singing my song
Oh no
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
I'm clinically insane
Walking home alone I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it getting high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now I'm so high I be fucking with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the morning with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

Running away from me but I'm not giving up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me but I'm not giving up on you no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things


Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for

You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You weren't there
(Skrrt)

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Sitting waiting at the gate for me
I heard this bitch blowing Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasing bitches, I was chasing dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Looking up at 'em like I never even knew them at all
I remember walking around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I tell there's something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself but I'm already in hell for it


I remember when you used to hold me close and say you love me
Now you acting like a ghost and that's okay I know I'm ugly
Now I'm swerving in the ghost and I'm okay I'm getting money
Now I'm switching up the coast, get out my way I stop for nothing
Give me some time and give me your patience
Came in the game last one month, fuck the game I'm done
Give me a sign and I'm going to take it
Whatever way I want
Bitch I get payed up front
I'm getting mine so fuck all your placements
Baby face I'm done
Fuck the place I'm from
Don't hit my line and say something basic
If it ain't about the money
Please don't waste no time
Looking out the edge, and I'm picturing the fall
I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on
If I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana
Put it in my bong then I make another song


Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers

Don't stutter, slang from the gutter, gotta' bang for ya' butter
Got my name from my mother
No other, shining thru' the shutter
Say she over me, whatever cause she underneath my cover
Bet you wish you had my flow
I know I'm dope, I could ask your hoe
Bet you wish you got me mad, you don't, you won't, not never,
Stop blowing up my phone

You wanna run that shit back for me?

Worry 'bout yourself baby, I'll be good
I just wanna die in peace tonight
You can see it in my face, so I wear my hood
Feeling like it's five degrees tonight
Everybody cold where I come from
Cut your mans down, you was looking for a come up
Next summer, I'll be on a island, with your bitch and a bottle
And a pocket full of numbers


I use to dream of you
Na,I use to lose my sleep for you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck witchu
I use to scream at you
I use to turn my cheek at you
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck bout me
And I ain't nothing to you
I'm just looking at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain,But I don't never complain
I'm insane I'm deranged,I see your face at the rain
This ain't no race for the fame,But at this pace I'ma make it
Face it,you basic, Lil Peep you're replacement
I'm taking your spot
I'll give it back when I'm raking the gwap
Maybe not
I keep on checking statements
I'm checking for payments
While you checking ya plays bitch

I been doing my own thing lately
I been holdin my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They  asking me how it feel,I say it's crazy
[x2]


When I'm coming down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again..

If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breaking down again..

But if I need to go
Just to show you I don't fucking care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch, that's cool with me
So act like you don't know
And I won't fucking stare at anybody else
The way I do, when it's only me and you..

You notice me [x4]
You know its me [x4]

It's me

My arms are searching for you
My arms are stretched out towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you


Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl
I'm all on my own
I'm all on my own
I know you ain't high as this
Putting my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flying bitch
Breaking my bones
You breaking my bones you want me to line my wrist
I ain't gon' do it for you
I'm gon' do it for me cause it help me forget
I ain't go put up no time
If you ain't got time if I ain't gon' bitch
I'm doing my thing
and bitch I can see all the disrespect in front of my face
Step in this bitch let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain't smoking on something imo dip
Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I'm growing so tired of this
How do you fight the feeling
How do you fight the feeling bitch
She calling my phone
She calling my phone I put it on quiet quick
I ain't never gon' answer it
I ain't never gon' pick up my phone girl

When you are on your own
Just know that I need you
I wont pick up the phone
Just know that I need you


Laying on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, tryna take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smoking thracks, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwing shade like you finna face me
You were always bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch I got plenty in my bottle it say Remy on my belt
That shit say Fetti in the back, green (bling)

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb cause they give me all their brains

Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Driving fast when she listening to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime pussy make me happy

Got me talking bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talking bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's something in the bud man I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins


Damn son, where'd you find this?

Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make her frumpet cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
Get my face recognised
We can do anything
Worth, greed, memory
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screamin' on my mind
And it's so fine
Make a grown man cry cry
If I take my time
And replace my crime
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wanna be


Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice put the blame on you

(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death)
Grab my knife find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
All the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice then its shame on u

Where did you go this time
What if I lose my mind
What if I make you cry
What if I die
What if I end my fucking life


I'mma take my time when I'm in it
I'mma make my mind up by tonight
No I can't die when I'm singing
I could live forever, way past the mic

These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passing by, no one noticed my angel wings
Getting high cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why, I might sing you a symphony


I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money getting tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't picking up a call, mirror on the wall

I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall


[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
She said she ain't never coming back
She ain't never coming back
I ain't never coming back bitch
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put u on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than..
See you leave just like the rest..
(See you leave just like the rest..)
Damn..

[Yung Goth:]

[Lil Peep:]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around

[Lil Skil:]
I can see it in your eyes, that u wanna get high
I can see it in your eyes, that u need it right now
How you need it right now

How you wanna good bye..

[Lil Skil & Lil Peep:]
I just wanna hear a sign from the narrow side of town
Baby we grillin' right now (woah)
Yeah I just wanna feel alive, baby take your time
Smoking on the spot (woah)

[Lil Peep:]
Girl you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me that's the best part baby the trust
Trust me
I got nothing for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie till the sun came up
All the places that you took me no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me now they on my nuts


My time is here and I'm making it clear
Oh I love you my dear
But I'm going, I'm gone
I might come back when the Benz all black
Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die I'mma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time but I never wanna do that again
Nothing worse than losing a friend
And the feeling you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waiting for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No I'm not gonna hurt you girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free
All you gonna get from me
Little bit a love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all


I been spending time
Time after time
Tryna get my mind right
But I just find I been lyin
Lying to myself
I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own
Baby I could handle mine
I could multiply..
I could satisfy..
Anybody tryn' see me shine
Man that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind
You been on my line
That's the reason why
I been working hard
You could stand aside
I could never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe

That's why she always crying tell me that
I'll live forever thru my vibe [x2]


Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, hoe
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, hoe

I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
But you got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burning down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(baby I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream
(baby I need you)

Girl I think I'm dying real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Ima keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wasting my time
Giving you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin truck out (skrr)
Trying to buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

Pop a bean, limousine, all in my hands
I know I'm lit, bitch you know I'm the man
I feel like Johnny Depp, Martin Scorcese a movie, hoe I feel like Superman
Hoe is lame, these bitches choosy
Mary Jane, Peter Parker, mixing lean and mud in water
I'm like fuck a brown, finesse your daughter, bitch I feel like Michael Phelps
Mary Jane, gold medals, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell
Coffin full of rose petals
Uh, ayy, [*mumbling*]


She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speeding down the highway, looking at the street lights
Geeking on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowing I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I should've curved you, I know I'm the worst boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe I swear she love getting high to
I love getting high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm making music to cry too

Oh it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo sho
Oh I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah I know

I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you acting like a ghost girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights getting high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone
I'm dying, I don't think that my bitch know

I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dying, I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dying, I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dying, yeah, yeah

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same

Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna come back to you
I know, I did a little blow and I never wrote back to you
My love, I wanna give it all to you
Baby I just wanna ball with you
I could see the air was coming near the way I do
About you now

Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same


[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal:]
Running up that hill, you pushin' me back
Think that I can make you want it bad
I don't need it though
(I don't need it though)

Sometimes you make me wait and make it like a plan
Wish that you could help me understand
Why? Because I don't know (I dunno)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like so alive
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
Fore me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It's the way, it is the way it really seem
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passing on and out
(And out, and out)
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt

[Lil Peep:]
It wasn't something that I thought about
But knew that you were absolute in doubt
I just really wanna talk to you again
That's how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end
It wasn't something 'til you brought it up
I knew that you were trying to make it out
Without a single scar, clawing at my arm
I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start
Bring me down, it's not that easy
Lay me down, just please don't leave me
I remember you were climbing on top of me
Why you acting like you fucking forgot me?
I've been dreaming about a place out in Hollywood
Tell my mama that I'm moving to Hollywood


Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first

Lying on the asphalt, Lil Peep blacked out
Fucking with the coatway, let my Mad Max out
I be on some real shit, get it from my OG
I don't wanna hear shit, shawty what she told me
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I be on my lonely
Looking for the right girl, why you all up on me?
Love me for a night, girl, hate me in the morning
Yeah I know your type girl, so I make her blow me
Lil Peep

Look me in my eyes, girl
Tell me if you think that it's a lie, girl
Getting tired of your girl
I know I need my own girl, my girl
[x2]

Jugging on a Friday, but I saw you on the freeway (Skrrt)
I can not forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first


[Lil Peep:]
I just wanna see you smile, I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true
I'll be on my own, no crew
Out here making these moves
Singing these big city blues
I don't wanna think about you
Every time I think about you
I swear I fall in love again
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real
Girl, I got a deal
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Coldhart

[Coldhart:]
And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beating heavy for me
And I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you got stars for eyes
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sitting drinking whiskey, hoping that you miss me
Baby say you do (please say you do)
Maybe say you do


Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
[x2]

Love now, cry later, cry later
But I always take the chance
But I always take the chance
If I could save her
If I could save her
She said she got other plans, damn

Hotel rooms and skyscrapers
I got a new pair of shoes to impress her
She fell in love with the devil, the worst
Love now, cry later, it hurts
[x2]


Hold me, I can't breathe
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna OD
Cup full of lean, pure codeine
Ten lines deep now I can't see
I don't wanna be this way for good, I don't wanna live the way I should
Born in the burbs but I'm big in the hood
Tell me that I can't but I know that I could
I can't hear you calling to me
I can't see you're falling for me

I can't hear you calling to me
I can't see you're falling for me
Hold me, I can't breathe
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna OD
Cup full of lean, pure codeine
Ten lines deep now I can't see

Born in the burbs but I'm big in the hood
Tell me that I can't but I know that I could


I don't wanna lose you

Why you gotta do me like that?

Little Bo Peep
Been in the same old jeans

But honestly, I've got regrets about you
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alright

I'm never sober now, I'm getting high all night
I'm about to put this in my system to erase you from my mind

[Horse Head:]
I was in lust with you
Thought that I loved you but I got the two confused
I don't wanna fall asleep with you in my head and I know that
You regret some things you said

Looking at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud

And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't getting nothing but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me

I be in The Bay, I be in LA
I be on stage, bitches kissing on my face
What I'm tryin to say
Let's take it by the day
I'm the one you want, not the one you trying to save

Tearing me apart, but I kinda like the pain
She like it when it rain
She like that I'm insane

She like me for my brain

Girl, you don't know my name

[Lil Tracy:]
True Religion jeans, pockets full of cocaine
Tattoos on my face, I'mma die this way
I don't wanna talk, so I flex and I finesse
Only inhale the best, exhale the stress
Used to be broke, I cast a spell on my check
Ice on my neck, now my ex sends me texts
Ask me if I still love her, I'm on xans, I forget
Bitch, did you forget? You cut through me like a wrist
I'm finna get rich, snortin' coke in a Benz
You don't know my name, you don't know my pain
On the highway to hell in a Beamer, switchin' lanes
Six hundred sixty six kisses on your face
Baby, now that I'm gone, do you hallucinate?
And see me in your room with that Gucci on my waist?
I'm so far away, now I'm in L.A
Gothic bitch, skinny waist, pussy drippin' like cocaine

Fake ass bitches plottin' on a Young Slugger
Diamorphine and I'm self medicatin', yeah
See different, you said you felt the same
Girl, I thought you knew my pain


[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby, watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall
I'll cop it all, castle halls

[Lil Tracy:]
Baby, I'm an asshole, walkin' thru my castle
I can break your heart, baby, I know it's so fragile
Step inside my castle, we blowin' on that good dope
Put this in your nostril, baby, I got good blow
Fuck her, then I vanish, disappear like magic
I live lavish, Gucci sheets all on my mattress
Goth Boy Clique, skrrt skrrt in a black whip
Pullin' down her skirt, I know you want it, you can't have it
Welcome to my castle, it's just me and you tonight
I think you're an angel, just a human in disguise
This is not rap, it's a goth lullaby
I'll be in your dreams every time that we get high
Lie, lie, lie, all you ever do is lie
Look me in my eyes like the stars in the sky
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die
Grew up in the mud in a castle, I'ma die

[LiL Peep:]
Watch me fall from these castle walls
I'll stand tall, baby watch me ball
Call after call, walk around the mall

I can't fuck with you if we weren't friends on Myspace
Lord why, Lord why do I wanna die?

I just fell in love with a bad bitch
Told me that she love me too, baby I'm not havin' it
Sniffin' cocaine cause I didn't have no Actavis
Smokin' propane with my clique and the bad bitches call me Cobain
She can see the pain
Look me in the eyes, girl we are not the same
Bitch I make it rain on my side bitch, shout out to my main
Fell in love once and I've never been the same

[Lil Tracy:]
Lil tracy, I used to rob, but I shop now
Comin' up, I might get recognized when I walk around
Coolin' with lil peep, lets hit the mall tomorrow
I'mma mix some American Eagle with some Ralph Lauren
I got a bad bitch who is good to me
Baby, I see passion in your eyes when you look at me
I'mma show you off like some Louis V
Coke lines on the mirror, snort a line for me

Cocaine in your bitch brain

But as long as I'm alive, we gon' shine, baby
Look me in my eyes, baby

And as long as I'm alive, I'mma die, baby
Time flies on the highway

Feels like we're a world away
But we in the same room, be my girl, today at least
She don't even know my name
But she look me in the eyes like she know my pain that's me
And she always let me be myself, she don't ever take bread
She don't need no help that's real
While I'm busy trying to get my wealth
She ain't worry about a thing except my dick and my health that's real

She sees things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me

Blood on my teeth, don't be walkin' down my street
I be in the dark, white bitch never eat
I be in the dark, white bitch never sleep
Pull up in a park and these bitches look at me (look at Peep)
Brick walls, ain't nobody getting in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now

[Lil Tracy:]
I dropped out of school, but that money comin' in
My mouth full of jewels, she like it when I grin
Tracy the prince, sippin' champagne inside of the Lyft
My castle big, I'm sorry girl but you can't come in
Lil Peep why, why do they hate?
My bitch so bad, told that bitch to behave
I run it up, they wanna see me crawl
All they do is talk, please get off my balls (yuh)
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now

Fuck you, fuck her, and fuck them
If I die today you would try to fuck my bitch

All this stress
Look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead
Dyin' out west
Tryin' my best
Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane
I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight

[Lil Tracy:]
Look in the mirror
I see a demon, I'm barely breathing
My shadow is bleeding
On the highway, baby, I'm speeding
I'm leavin' the city, you should be with me
Two weeks with the same old jeans on
I know you want to die, baby, this is your theme song
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on

Black jeans, half black hoes

[Lil Tracy:]
In high school I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on

Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you

Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go

[Lil Tracy:]
Here we go again, wakin' up again
I know a lot of shit, but I don't know what day it is
I really like you, but I'ma die fast
So you should run away, and don't look back
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up baby I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood
I was wide awake, you were havin' a nightmare
You said you think that you're in Hell, I'll catch a flight there
I'll be right there, for you
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up, baby, I don't give a fuck

Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
Goth Boi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

Stayed inside my head

16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I try to go, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time

10 years ago I went blind, I been on my own since age nine

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're just sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that It's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

B-B-Bis Los on the track, boy

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You-you could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (For sure)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (and you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could I could-I could, uh, uh

I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool (like a fool)
Eatin' lemon pepper, with a lepper playin' pool
Damn, my man a Cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I can not get enough
So I'm strictly smokin' wax , 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gain, I need me a sad bitch
My life, ain't lavish, I ain't ever had a shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you had it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my thrown laughin'
Lil Peep spazzin', skeetin' on your mattress
Creepin' through the night time, blood on my classics

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)

She can not keep your cool, and you let her (and you let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

I could-I could, I could-I could

She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
'Cause the blood don't show, hoe
I can not, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can't do, 'fore the puffin'
Gon' have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money you would be lickin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is distinctive
What's that money for the takin' 'cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then, spend your life in the pen'
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man?

I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds are that loud, like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepards (Kiki Shepards)
I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can not keep your cool, and you let her (Let her)
I could keep my cool while I'm eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

Pepper
Twice the effort, under pressure
Twice the effort, under pressure

Young punk bitch, fucking on a young bitch
Fell in love when she saw me in the club, bitch
Young punk bitch, fucking on a drunk bitch

Standing in the club like lil mama in my eyesight
She go home with me tonight then we connect like Wi-Fi
Yayo on the table, Gucci on my waist too
Got my switchblade, tonight you'll be safe

Gemstone switchblade and I will pull it out
The club going up, baby, will you hold me down?
Hella ice on my wrists, he thought my wrists sprained
I'm in your driveway, baby lets skrrt away

[Lil Peep:]
I just fell in love with a bad bitch
Told me that she love me too, baby I'm not havin' it
Sniffin' cocaine cause I didn't have no Actavis
Smokin' propane with my clique and the bad bitches call me Cobain
She can see the pain
Look me in the eyes, girl we are not the same
Bitch I make it rain on my side bitch, shout out to my main
Fell in love once and I've never been the same

[Lil Tracy:]
Lil tracy, I used to rob, but I shop now
Comin' up, I might get recognized when I walk around
Coolin' with lil peep, lets hit the mall tomorrow
I'mma mix some American Eagle with some Ralph Lauren
I got a bad bitch who is good to me
Baby, I see passion in your eyes when you look at me
I'mma show you off like some Louis V
Coke lines on the mirror, snort a line for me

Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique make a hoe shake
Black fur, black coat
Gothboiclique in the back hoe
Switchblades, cocaine
Gothboiclique till my soul take
Black jeans, half black hoes
Gothboiclique in the castle

[Lil Tracy:]
In high school I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die bury with all my ice on

Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Lil Tracy:]

She like, "How the fuck you do that?"
I can’t be there all the time
But you know I gotta prove that
I can't leave here anytime soon (Nah)
I got somethin' to do, yeah

Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I’m goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams

When I met your mom, she told me I was handsome
You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin’ in my eyes

[Lil Peep:]
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands

She's trying to find the...

She's trying to find the words
I'm trying to find this girl
But it's so dark and I was under club lights

Call me on my iphone
I don't pick it up much
I've been losing friends, I don't feel right

4 Gold Chains, gave 2 to my brothers
Fame bring pain, but the pain make money
Keep it 100 baby girl what's your number?
Girls numb the pain and the drugs get me numb-er

I had a plan to kill
Myself and you for real
With my gun, I'll take your life
I'm no fun without my knife

If I I want to I will cut you, I will make you feel my pain
If I need to I will bleed you, I will make you go insane
When the time comes I will sacrifice my love in the moonlight
Whenever I cum I feel half as nice as I did when it's you, right


Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Running out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die, would you even cry?
If I end my life, would you hold me tight then?

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal (Døves):]
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
(And I'm so lost), under club lights
(In the all black), GothBoiClique

[Lil Peep:]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal (Døves):]
(Fucked up in the back of the club)
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
(I got scars on me, no love)
Light a candle and I pray for doves
(And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue)
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
(I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood)
(It's so fucked)
So tell me what is love
(If I ever had it), if I ever had it
(Did I really want it?)
(And why can't I remember?)
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
(It's a slow drug)
And I swear that
(But it's true love)
These are true lines

[Døves:]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

[Lil Peep:]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise

Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me

[Lil Tracy:]
I know you love xans, but there is no way you forgot about the way that I held your hand
Should we try again, give it another chance
I don't think it's worth it, I don't think it's worth it
Pouring red wine in a chalice
I sip slow, can't spill it on my fabric
You're like a switchblade, cut right through me
I kinda like it though, baby, cut through me
Vampire in the club in the back now
Heartthrob girls have me as their background
I don't care though, I want you to care though
I cast a love spell, baby, you'll be back though

Call me up tryna fuck

Back of the club, fucked up on some other shit
All I ever wanted was a Benz and a bad bitch

All I ever wanted was a friend
All I ever wanted was a brand new Benz truck
Now I wonder where my friends gon' end up
Money don't help with the pain, where the drugs at?
Make a few racks, call the plug back
She like baby, where you goin'? When you comin' back?
I'ma be away for a month
When I get back we can fuck
I'ma be away for a lifetime
Everything I say at the right time
Givin girls cocaine, white wine
Everyone afraid of my lifestyle

It's alright to tell me
What you think about me
I won't try to argue
Or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving
You must have your reasons
The season is calling
Your pictures are falling down

The steps that I retrace
The sad look on your face
The timing and structure
Did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short
I'm writing the report
On losing and failing
When I move I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you
At a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by
On the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave
We'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last
When he's gone, I won't come back

And it'll happened once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up

Look at my outfit, somebody count me
Choke on my dick if you're trying to shade me
I don't give a fuck if you're trying to play me
I don't give a fuck if you're trying to save me
Yeah I got bitches not one of them date me

[Eddy Baker:]
Know I pulled up with a box of blunts
Range Rover filled with sluts
Shoe box filled with blunts
Rolling up that stinky skunk
Light it up, they know what's up
Getting money with my bros
Bad bitches they show us love
Hit the crib and let us fuck
Came in sober leaving drunk
Young nigga I'm having fun
Lean in my hawwiian punch
Drank too much I'm throwing up
All my shows be going up
That's why your girl be choosing us
[?]
My life like Ferris Bueller [?]
Posted in the breakfast club
Just like [?] smoking drugs
Where's my molly we're gon try and see if she fuck with a thug
Healthyboyz cartel
Got narcotics if you need a buzz
Blowing all my money on designer cause I'm young and dumb


Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ride around downtown with me
Everyone wanna ride around town with Peep

I be in the backseat smoking on thraxx
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B, Free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back

Everyone wanna ride around town with me

[Lil Peep:]
I'll be right here, when you step out the car
I see you from afar, but I know who you are
I know exactly who you are, what you're looking for
I know exactly where it starts, and I'm not looking forward to the end
Because we're not gonna last
Because we took it too fast, and that's a good way to crash and burn
What I learned, I don't like taking my turn
If she mine, she gon' be mine until we ash in an urn
Let me burn, let me swerve, let me pull up on the curb
Now I'm looking so absurd, But I'm all that they heard, at the party pull-up rari
Up in the haze on the scene up in the haze on the scene
Light a hundred fuckin' dutchs and then I follow my dreams
Girl you're fuckin with Lil Peep, I'm the king of the teens
I just dropped a couple singles and take over the scene
Got the internet buzzing, 20 thousand a week
Now I practice getting pussy, I practice all that I preach
Peep

[Gizmo:]
I'll be right there when you need me close
I'll always be around when you need me the most
But I know, that you've been trying to get away from me
But you just don't know what to say to me
I just gotta do what I think I'm meant to
Everything I said is true in that text I sent you
So if you ain't gon' be my boo, then just do you
I'm smoking blunts, like they cigarettes
I still ain't shit, I ain't gotten any bigger yet
But that factor ain't something that really matters to me
Ain't nothing to think about when I'm chilling, smoking my weed
I burn it down, and then proceed to seek out all my hopes and dreams
The future holds itself so it ain't really what it seems
If I can't get to where I want, I'll be pissed
I'll tie my neck up in a noose, kick the chair and slit my wrists

She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head
Playing with your hair, laying in my bed
I got some drugs on the nightstand, I feel dead

I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me

Baby, it's no fair, girl, I'm a mess
If you drive by, I want you to stop there and give me a kiss
I remember your blonde hair
I remember your black hair
I remember your red hair from last fall
I can't forget about anything at all

She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head
Playing with your hair, laying in my bed
I got some drugs on the nightstand, I feel dead

I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me


Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?
Now I'm your everything and I've got you on your knees
I got this little problem - I might make you bleed
"So what's the problem?" - she said
"Baby, make me scream!"

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me

I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you


[Lil Peep:]
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, that's what I told myself
I don't even know myself
Got my back up against the wall
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, I told myself
I don't even know myself
Or control my self at all

I can't tell what I want, I can't tell what you want
She can't tell what I'm on
What do you want? Let me sing you a song

[Lil Tracy:]
I wanna hold you so close like a switchblade
I really mean that, I know you don't believe it
I'm shining so hard, I know that you can see that
I'd give it up though, I swear I'd give it up though
We're moving so fast, I don't care, I wanna crash
Let our love burn, let our love burn
We're moving so fast, I don't care, I wanna crash
Let our love burn, let our love burn

[Lil Peep:]
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, that's what I told myself

You were the one, I told myself
I don't even know myself
Or control my self at all

[Vic Fuentes:]

And I can hear you...


[Lil Peep:]
Woah, yeah

[iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep:]
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your needle starts my heart, oh

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm dreamin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

[Lil Peep:]
Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine but I'll do it fine

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'

[Patrick Stump:]
I been dreamin'
Of your uniform, your uniform of non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough, the years aren't long enough, no

[iLoveMakonnen:]
Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm dreamin' for your touchin' on the daily

[Patrick Stump:]
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
(Always on the tip of my tongue)

[iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep:]
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')
Long for you (Long for you)

[Lil Peep:]
I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll cast a vibe that we can't forget

[iLoveMakonnen & Patrick Stump:]
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood

And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
(I'll be waiting for you)


[Lil Peep:]
Now I'm one step closer to hell
I can feel the ghostway comin' on
Thirty bitches wanna fuck me though
Same bitches that was hatin' on my first song
Now they say they want to fuck me with my jays on
Drugs gone, probably 'cause, me and pain, took 'em off
Nobody told you I got tears on my shirt
Blame me self if you ever get hurt, somebody kill
Drugged out, plug house, try to cop another fix
Fans all up on my dick, but they don't know my government
There till I'm fuckin' rich
Lil peep, lil pain, tell 'em hoes, suck a dick
Brokeboy sad as shit, I don't really give a shit
Sellin' reggie by a brick
[?] they couldn't make me trip
They mad, they couldn't make me flip
Hit a bitch, hit a dip, nineties baby, gettin' lit
Bang, Bang, hit a lick, liquid got me ignorant

[Lil Pain:]
I'm Reggie Bush, Reggie Miller, Reggie Jackson
In my hood they call me reggie
Cause' the reggie's what I'm packin'
Sippin', trippin', trickin', smokin', thinkin', shit that you can [?]
All these tits keep overflowin', told lil peep to pass a [?]
I'm lookin' in the mirror, [?] just a stranger
I see pain, I see sorrow, I see her, I see angle
Put the [?] to my head
And this [?] in the chamber
Now my eyes are bloody red
That means all I see is danger
There's bitch inside my bed
She ain't muscle, I won't blame her
She keep cryin', I keep lyin' but the true is I won't save her
So now she hates me but that's fine, because I hate my self
The truth is I'm tryin' to save my self
Peep waddup


Spoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast
The words "I love you" meant so much, now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and think about our first kiss by the tree and how it meant so much to

Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But, all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But I think of you on the road
You know, I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said "I hate you" 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

Ya got one more chance at a night like this (Yeah, yeah)

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

And that's real shit (real), we keep it real, bitch (real)
I'm a goth boy, kinda like my whole clique
You a bad one (true), we should have fun
Let's fuck in the all-black Benz truck (skrrr, skrr)
Six racks on (Peep), six packs gone (sheesh)
I'm a bad boy, we ain't gonna last long (nah)
I could make you (damn), I could break you (yeah)
Baby, think of all the places I can take you

What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'mma die young, I'ma get killed
What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'mma die young, baby, I'ma get killed, aye

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

Bad bitch riding on me rolling off the molly
That's your girl? Wait, hold up she ain't let me know it
Instagram, she posting photos just hoping I notice
Step in the club, they tryna get cameras in focus
I'm a vampire, I do not like the light on me
Fuck a friend, fuck a homie
I'm all by my lonely
Kush smoking, wine pouring at four in the morning
Peep and Tracy, two Mercedes, we race to the castle
No new friends, I feel like Drake baby I'm such a asshole
Break the cocaine off the brick and put it in her asshole
Vampire in the moonlight counting up the pesos

[Lil Peep:]
Blowing kisses in the wind
I'ma show her how I swim when the lights get dim

We just met on meeting ends

[Horse Head:]
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But it's alright (but it's alright)
But it's alright

I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But it's alright (but it's alright)

[Lil Peep:]
You got my number yet? Six hundred sixty-six
Diamond rings, I'm a devil with some angel wings
I know a lot of shit, I don't ever talk shit
Lil Peep, big dick, ask my ex bitch
I've been through a lot of shit, it got me flexing
I've been through a lot of shit, so it got me sexting
Got sucked up twice in the same night
Call my baby on the west, catch a late flight
She just hang tight, I know a lot of girls like you
But my world falls down when I fight you
Beside you, can I remind you?
I wanna die too, I wanna die too

[Horse Head:]

[Lil Tracy:]
Clinically depressed gang, GothBoiClique
Wine in my chalice, take a hundred sips
Hundred girls on my dick, but I just want you
Vampire bite your neck, blood on my lip
French kiss, baby now you're one of us
Now you speak my language, they can't understand us
I'm hot, coming up like the sunrise
But I feel most alive, in the moonlight

[Lil Peep:]
Waitin' for my death, while I count some tens
Shawty layin' on my chest in the back of the Benz
I can see you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
I don't even know you, but you act like we're friends?
She ain’t gonna meet another one like me
Puts you to the ground while you kept walkin'
Yeah, it say "Gucci" on my plain white tee
That's a grown man flex, stop playin' with me

[YungJZAisDead:]
Baby, I was blazin' in my plain white tee

See me in the dark waitin' patiently for you, tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch


We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same
If you couldn't tell
It's just another day
In this Little town
We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same
If you couldn't tell
It's just another day

I can get through this

I can get through this
I can get through this

I'm bout' to give her everything she ever wanted and more
What I deliver, it's something that can't be bought at the store
I'm tryna bring you with me, baby, while I'm finding myself
That feeling when you kiss me tells me I don't need no one else
I had to lose my mind a couple times to find out it's you
I had to run around the world, girl, just to be here, it's true
These other women don't got nothing on the way that she moves
Let's pick up right where we left off last night, inside of my room

When the time come
I'll be right here
Sippin' liquor with a grin on my face, for you
I got nothing left to keep me awake
I don't got no better thing to do than sit here and wait
For you
For you
For you
For you

I can get through this (For you)
I can get through this (For you)
I can get through this (For you)

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

Sometimes life gets fucked up, that's why we get fucked up
I can still feel your touch, I still do those same drugs

That we used to do, I was used to you
What have you been through? she asked me
Every fuckin kind of abuse
If you loved me too, you would give me you
Lock me in your room, don't tell me the truth
Everything you said (everything you said)
Stayed inside my head (stayed inside my head)
All the shit you said, all the blood I bled

Loving you is like a fairytale
I just can't pick up the phone again
This time I'll be on my own, my friend
One more time, I'm all alone again

Sex with you is like I'm dreaming, and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now you're gone, I can't believe that
Time I spent with you deceiving me
I don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leaving me
I don't care if you believe me
I still wonder why you tease me

And if I'm taking this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)
I hope you know I'm faded, all of this liquor I'm drinking
And if I'm taking this the wrong way (wrong way)
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinking
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)
It's when you put me in the spotlight (spotlight)

When the moon hit your skin, I could see you and him
Not you and me, yeah, but it's just you and me, yeah
When the sun shines above, you wake up with the one you love
Not you and me, yeah, but it's just you and me, yeah
(All alone again)

Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect (yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it

Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my face, when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings

None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea

Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week

Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

Can't believe it's the last night, the last fight with you

If I had one night I would spend it with you
I need help real soon, imma die in my room
Do you wanna 'come fly
To get high as the moon

Nobody spread my wings tonight
I'm gonna pack my things tonight
Phones on ring tonight
The angels sing tonight
No matter what you bring tonight
I'm gone in the fight
Peep gone make it right
Peep gone make it right

Passing time, gettin' high in the candle light
Gettin' money, I be flying
You can stay at the side
Feeling hard
I wanna die, never live my life
You can see it in my eyes
That I can't decide
Fucked up but my heart still beats for you
Broken heart - Can't breath in the waiting room
Now faith, put the test of forgetting you
Got the whole club back trying get it through

[Lil Peep:]
Many men have tried to save you but all they do is try
Woke up on a lonely day, she can't help but wonder why
I saw it on her face, she wanna make those fuckers cry
She ends up in a better place inside when she get high

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
Stick that needle in my eye

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Pour that drip up in my faygo
In my city y'all gotta say so
I was just talking to Fredo
Then I woke up he was gone
All my friends are really dead
Still hear their voices in my head
These days it's hard to sleep alone
I beg my baby, please don't go
Please don't go
I can handle my rivals but can't fight these demons alone
Please don't go
All these fakes, all these snakes in the grass gotta keep it cut low
Keep the circle small, stand tall through it all
Praying I don't fall, no they'd rather see me long gone

[Lil Peep:]
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times

Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
Stick that needle in my eye
When I lie
Cuts me when I lie
When I lie


Lately I've been flexing hard on my ex
Baby I've been leaning hard on this Tech
I can see the scars on your neck
I can see the stars in your eyes

Lately I've been flexing hard on my ex
Baby I've been leaning hard in this tech
I can see the scars on your neck
And I can see the stars in your eyes
Right now you're the only thing on my mind
Got me rolling, sipping, smoking dope to get me high
Baby I've been trying hard to get by
Baby girl trying hard just to get fly for me

She would die for me, ride for me
Spend a night with me, don't fight with me
She in the Beamer with me, two seater with me
Say she love me cause I know that's what she needed from me
My bitch bleeding for me, she never cheated on me
She wanna fuck with me forever when she fucking on me
Come and fuck with me, baby, I ain't fucking for free
Come and fuck with me, baby, come and fuck with a G
